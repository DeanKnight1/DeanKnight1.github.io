<p>The real reason cameras are generally released is to lower much pettier criminal activities. However it has actually not even been demonstrated that they can do that.

"As soon as the criminal activity and offence figures were adjusted to appraise the general downward pattern in criminal offenses and offences," criminologists found in one study, "decreases were noted in particular classifications but there was no evidence to suggest that the cameras had minimized crime overall in the city centre."
