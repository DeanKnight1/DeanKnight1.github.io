<p>No. Monitored medical alarms are not included in this new law. These alarms differ from panic alarms, which are covered. Panic alarms get police response based on fear of impending injury or bodily harm due to criminal activity, while medical alarms usually receive fire response based upon an emergency due to a pre-existing (doctor-diagnosed) medical condition.

<p>The NVR eliminates these problems, due to the fact that it is instead linked directly to a network. IP cameras that are linked to the exact same network, normally by method of a PoE switch, are then able to transmit video footage to the NVR. Systems based around an NVR are much easier to scale up than DVR systems, merely because they can accept a new camera once it is added to the network. In the worst case, all that would be needed is an extra PoE switch. Some IP cameras are also wireless and can send video footage to the NVR over Wi-Fi. There are no proximity constraints so long as a camera is linked to the same network as the NVR. The biggest disadvantage to an NVR system, nevertheless, is that not every IP camera will work with every NVR.

(We believe this is a more valuable function if you're positioning the Circle 2 outside, where vehicles often pass.) Although having the subscription makes this camera smarter, it's fantastic that it's not needed, as it is with some cameras, consisting of the Nest Webcam.</p>
