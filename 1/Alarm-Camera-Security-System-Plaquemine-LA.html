<p>3 huge advantages of wireless security systems for occupants are their impermanence, expandability and portability. Renters, unlike homeowners, normally prevent making irreversible changes to their homes.

On the other hand, wireless security utilizes equipment that's either freestanding or affixed to walls and entrances with detachable adhesive. Wireless control panels, sensors and other elements can easily be set up at different homes later, and wireless systems are easily expanded with new parts too. Wireless security strategies also permit remote control of the system and basic home automation.
