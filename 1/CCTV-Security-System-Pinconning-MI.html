<p>A dome CCTV camera gets its name from the dome-shaped housing that the camera beings in. Whilst these are relatively discreet CCTV cameras in appearance, this doesn't stop them from deterring criminals.

<p>No matter what kind of alarm you have, many alarm systems work the exact same way. They use open and closed circuits to move an electric current. When this electrical current is not being moved it triggers an alarm system. In closed circuit security systems, the electrical current is transferred when the doors are shut. Which suggests if the doors are shut electrical current can be transferred throughout the circuits. Which would then set off the burglar alarm if somebody were to open the door that would mean that the electrical current can no longer be transferred. However, in an open circuit security system, opening the door allows for the electrical current to stream throughout the system, which means when the doors are shut the burglar alarm will trigger.</p>
