<p>Some wireless home security systems use a video recording storage option and others do not. For the ones that don't, you are able to see a live video feed of your home whenever you access your system; nevertheless, nothing is tape-recorded.

This option is generally cost-free. A cloud storage option conserves your video in the cloud.
