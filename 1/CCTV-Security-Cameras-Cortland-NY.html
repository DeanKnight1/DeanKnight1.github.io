<p>The Alarm Systems & Intrusion Detection product category is a collection of news, product listings and other resources for security experts investigating Alarm Systems & Intrusion Detection products. We thought about both the TP-Link Kasa Area (KC100) and the Kasa Web Cam (KC120) for among our top spots. Nevertheless, neither design has geofencing, and the KC120 left spaces of as much as 25 seconds in between recordings. The Area can tape as much as 3 minutes without gaps in between clips, however entries were frequently missing, in spite of appearing in the app's activity timeline. With standard wise home devices like automated door locks, you can stay in bed and check that you locked your doors. And a video doorbell lets you keep an eye out for prospective package thieves or talk to visitors who come by.</p>
