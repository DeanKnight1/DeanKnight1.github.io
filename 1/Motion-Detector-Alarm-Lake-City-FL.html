<p>So, while alarm systems may have some benefit for alarm owners as part of a general security package, the concern remains whether non-alarm owners in the community must shoulder a share of the cost. If alarm usage led to boosted public safety-- that is, alarms caused much higher burglar apprehension rates or, preferably, less break-ins throughout a whole jurisdiction-- its public worth would be more evident. Nevertheless, the truth that alarm calls are overwhelmingly incorrect and do not contribute considerably to authorities capability to collar robbers makes the underwriting of alarm reaction by cops and entire communities (all taxpayers support cops response to alarmed properties) a expensive and inefficient  approach to break-in decrease throughout a whole jurisdiction.</p>

If burglars can not see any security cameras, they might also be less mindful about covering their faces and their tracks.</p>
