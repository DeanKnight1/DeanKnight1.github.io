<p>I just ended up updating all of my stock annke cameras with this model. The crucial distinction with this bullet camera is it has a horizontal adjustment which permits you to fine-tune the field of view 1000% much better than a camera without a horizontal change.

Need to be a better method to execute that. However it was simply a little notch so not an offer breaker. Excellent resolution - far better field of view vs the stock annke cameras and far better clearness in the evening. Ideally these hold up for many years! Highly suggest.</p>
