<p>The growing existence of public cameras will bring extensive but subtle changes to the character of our public spaces. When residents are being seen by the authorities - or aware they may be viewed at any time - they are more awkward and less free-wheeling. As syndicated writer Jacob Sullum has actually pointed out, "knowing that you are being viewed by armed federal government representatives tends to deter things. You do not want to upset them or otherwise call attention to yourself." Ultimately, he cautions, "individuals might learn to be careful about the regulars and books they check out in public, avoiding titles that might alarm unseen observers. They might also put more thought into how they dress, lest they look like terrorists, gang members, drug addicts or hookers." Undoubtedly, the research studies of cameras in Britain discovered that individuals considered to be "out of time and place" with the environments were subjected to extended surveillance.</p>

Window sensing units are easily hid behind drapes or blinds, and door sensing units are so small that they tend to mix into the doorframe. You can conceal a wireless camera much easier than you can one with wires. Wireless is the better option if you want home security that mixes into your design and does not draw attention to itself. Wireless systems are likewise perfect for renters because they don't require opening the wall, and can quickly be taken with you when you relocate to your next place. If you're wanting to improve your apartment's security, or simply wish to keep an eye on your location while you're out, consider installing a portable wireless security system.</p>
