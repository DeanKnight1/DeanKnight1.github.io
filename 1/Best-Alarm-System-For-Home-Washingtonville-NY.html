PTZ cameras are remotely managed, and permit the operator to pan (relocation left or best), tilt up and or down, or zoom more detailed or further away in order to follow individuals as they move. This lets operators focus on specific areas or track specific motions. The cameras can also run patterns or turn to a preset position.</p>

<p>Neither the light nor the camera is especially outstanding by itself. The Maximus Smart Security Light camera is HD, however it's just 720p-- and we're starting to expect 1080p, if not 4K, from the security camera market. With that stated, we would not recommend this system to tech-lovers, as we think the features are a little too basic. For example, we would have liked to see an outdoor camera and more wise home features. However if easy Do It Yourself installation, no-contracts, and low-cost monitoring is your thing, we believe you'll enjoy SimpliSafe.</p>
