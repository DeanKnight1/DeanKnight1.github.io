<p>Although 360 ° and 720 ° cameras may have the very same resolution specification as that of a basic IP camera, that resolution is being spread over a much broader location and therefore offers fewer pixels per inch. Here is what this indicates, by method of an example. Assume two cameras, one a basic camera with a 130 ° field of vision and the other a 720 ° camera, and both cameras are high-resolution 10MP (megapixel) models. This suggests the 720 ° camera has far less resolution per square inch; it is starting with the same image sensor, 10MP in this case, though it has to spread that image across a far larger area and for that reason will not look as crisp of a camera that just has a 130 ° field of view.</p>

<p>Neither the light nor the camera is particularly excellent on its own. The Maximus Smart Security Light camera is HD, however it's only 720p-- and we're starting to expect 1080p, if not 4K, from the security camera market.
