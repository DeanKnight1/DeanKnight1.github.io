<p>Unlike a lot of other cameras we evaluated, the corded Circle 2 does not have sensitivity settings for motion detection (though the cordless model does ). Rather, you can filter event notices just by high activity, days, or person (the latter is offered only with a paid Circle Safe subscription). Without a paid Circle Safe membership, you'll get more alerts, which you can only filter to receive every minute, 15 minutes, or thirty minutes. When utilized in high-traffic locations, the subscription is more beneficial. Otherwise, the Smart Area function can be set to disable recording when you're home-- to avoid notifies each time you stroll by. Unusually, though the app supports several users, its geofencing applies to each user individually, so if everybody in your family has the Circle app set up, you'll still get notices when other people are home.</p>
