<p>I simply completed updating all of my stock annke cameras with this model. The crucial difference with this bullet camera is it has a horizontal modification which permits you to fine-tune the field of vision 1000% much better than a camera without a horizontal modification.

Should be a better way to execute that. However it was just a little notch so not a deal breaker.
