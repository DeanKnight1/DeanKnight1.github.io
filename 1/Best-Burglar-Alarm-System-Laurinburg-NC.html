However, you do need to subscribe to the external monitoring service (from ₤ 12.99 monthly) to be able to view recording from the wifi security camera and get alerts on your phone if the sensing units have been activated. There's no external alarm either. Other packages are readily available that have extra sensors and key fobs, too.</p>
