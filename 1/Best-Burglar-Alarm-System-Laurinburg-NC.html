<p>Somewhat more expensive than our winning smart alarm, this system was almost as easy to install and, throughout testing, the loud, clear siren was quick to sound if among the sensing units had been triggered. We love that the system consists of a wifi security camera and only signals you when motion is created by something with the exact same heat pattern as a human (ensuring there's no false signals). However, you do need to subscribe to the external monitoring service (from â‚¤ 12.99 monthly) to be able to view recording from the wifi security camera and get alerts on your phone if the sensing units have been activated. There's no external alarm either. Other packages are readily available that have extra sensors and key fobs, too.</p>
