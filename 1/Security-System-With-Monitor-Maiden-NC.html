<p>Commercial-grade cameras fix this problem with a special light-handling feature. These cameras use both a software application and hardware solution called HDR, which represent High Dynamic Variety". In our example here, HDR takes a direct exposure of the room and a direct exposure of the doorway and then integrates the two images together to produce a properly-exposed composite picture of the 2 areas. As far as anybody is worried, the image looks completely typical because the entrance and room seem at the exact same brightness level. As a result, faces are properly exposed at the door and in the store, achieving the objective of catching video of everyone getting in the store. HDR is now a standard feature in commercial cameras.

<p>Connecting analog cameras with a DVR system is done by way of straight plugging a BNC cable television from the DVR into the camera. To link more cameras to the DVR system, you require additional cables. DVR systems are tough to scale up since as soon as every BNC connection is occupied by a camera, you need to purchase an entirely new DVR before including another camera to the system. DVRs likewise require that the connected cameras remain in close proximity to the recorder; otherwise, the video quality begins to degrade.</p>
<p>Aside from good Wi-Fi, you may likewise need a close-by outlet. Many cameras need an A/C connection, which indicates you won't have the ability to place them simply anywhere. Several of the cameras we tested offered the alternative to utilize battery power, however we have yet to discover the ideal one.
