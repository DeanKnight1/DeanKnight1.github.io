<p>The Arlo Pro 3 is not fantastic however good-- therefore it isn't worth paying twice the cost of its predecessor. When the two are compared side by side, the Arlo Pro 3 does edge out the Pro 2 on battery life and image, with 2K HDR video that is sharper throughout day and nighttime viewing. Nevertheless, color night vision image quality is disappointing, and the motion tracking feature is a bit wonky. Also, the Pro 3 provides no complimentary storage, and external storage can't be viewed through the app, only through a computer. We will keep monitoring the Arlo Pro 3, but for now, we still think the Arlo Pro 2 is a much better buy. Both are still much better than the pricey Arlo Ultra, which we found to have terrible night-vision performance, bad battery life, and a propensity to miss far too many motion triggers.</p>

In addition, it does not get activated by small items. As such, Arlo Pro 2 has among the most advanced motion sensors that remove all incorrect alarms and just gets triggered when people approach it.</p>
