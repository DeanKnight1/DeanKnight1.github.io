<p>ADT authorized provider SafeStreets charges a $99 (or more) installation cost, however the brand name does not otherwise charge up front for a system it says is worth $1,300. The equipment's all supplied by third parties, so what you receive might be from a different maker than the equipment your next-door neighbor got. Why's that?

<p>Best Professional Installation Security Company - While some security systems offer simple Do It Yourself installation, other companies offer (and sometimes need) professional installation. Expert installation is offered for wireless and hardwired home security systems. Keep in mind that cameras with two-way audio normally work like walkie talkies.
