<p>Storage: Cloud storage (where video is saved on a remote server operated by the maker, instead of at your house) is the standard nowadays, but some cameras keep recordings locally on a microSD card or a connected disk drive.

<p>The Wi-Fi Protected Gain Access To (WPA and WPA2) security protocols were later developed to address the issues with WEP. If a weak password, such as a dictionary word or short character string is utilized, WPA and WPA2 can be cracked. Utilizing a long enough random password (e.g. 14 random letters) or passphrase (e.g. 5 randomly selected words) makes pre-shared crucial WPA practically uncrackable. The second generation of the WPA security procedure (WPA2) is based on the last IEEE 802.11 i change to the 802.11 requirement and is qualified for FIPS 140-2 compliance.
