Recordings are recorded as 10-second clips that are stored for as much as 24 hr, unless you pay the $8 month-to-month fee (or $80 each year) to keep 30-second clips for one month. Beyond those limits, we typically discovered action missing out on, thanks to prolonged and inconsistent spaces in between recordings. Likewise, the camera itself gets exceptionally hot.</p>
