This is not the case as wireless cameras might still require a power cord. Wired security cameras are linked to a recorder directly which then links to the internet and a router.

As a result, faces are properly exposed at the door and in the shop, accomplishing the objective of recording video of everyone entering the store. HDR is now a standard function in commercial cameras. Unfortunately, when customers realize that the affordable consumer camera they purchased is doing not have HDR, it's generally too late considering that the recorders and cameras are set up.</p>
