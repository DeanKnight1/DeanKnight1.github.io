<p>Commercial-grade cameras solve this problem with an unique light-handling feature. These cameras use both a software application and hardware option called HDR, which mean High Dynamic Range". In our example here, HDR takes an exposure of the space and an exposure of the entrance and after that combines the two images together to create a properly-exposed composite picture of the 2 areas. As far as anybody is worried, the image looks totally regular considering that the entrance and space appear to be at the exact same brightness level. As an outcome, faces are correctly exposed at the door and in the store, accomplishing the goal of recording video of everybody getting in the shop. HDR is now a basic function in commercial cameras. Regrettably, when customers understand that the inexpensive consumer camera they bought is lacking HDR, it's normally far too late because the recorders and cameras are installed.</p>
