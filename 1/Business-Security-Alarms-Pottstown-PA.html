The Arlo Pro 2 is likewise the only cord-free 1080p camera on our list that offers 7 days of totally free cloud storage (with more available for a regular monthly charge ). However, the camera will reset the sensing unit in between recordings, which Arlo states will enable the camera to correctly find motion and not get stuck recording on a loop.
