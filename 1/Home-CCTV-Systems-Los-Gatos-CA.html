<p>I simply completed upgrading all of my stock annke cameras with this design. The crucial distinction with this bullet camera is it has a horizontal change which enables you to fine-tune the field of vision 1000% better than a camera without a horizontal adjustment. No clue why more bullet cameras do not have this extremely essential function. Likewise great metal building and construction. Needed to hold the button down for 5 seconds to the left to get right mode not in white and black. Had to make the wire hole a little larger to fit the substantial choice device into the wall. Must be a much better method to execute that. But it was just a little notch so not an offer breaker. Great resolution - far better field of vision vs the stock annke cameras and better clearness at night. Ideally these hold up over the years! Highly recommend.</p>
