<p>To gauge response times for the monitoring company, we triggered each system a minimum of 5 times, utilizing contact and motion sensors. However, bear in mind that the monitoring company's response time has absolutely nothing to do with the speed at which your local authorities will react to the alarm-- if they react at all. In Los Angeles, for instance, all alarm calls need to be verified, either by an eyewitness or through video or audio from a surveillance camera or microphone.

Rules such as these are created to restrict the time and resources that cops and fire departments waste on incorrect alarms. Numerous towns will fine you for a lot of false alarms.</p>

Ring Alarm supports Z-Wave, so you can incorporate your smart outlets with your general security system. With the advances in technology, monitoring a home security system is relatively easy.
