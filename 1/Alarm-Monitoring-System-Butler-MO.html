Besides requiring longer wires for the cameras that I do not wish to buy whatever works good! Then this system is for you, if you are like me and generally set things up without directions It has clear picture and simple to establish.

<p>I just ended up updating all of my stock annke cameras with this design. The key distinction with this bullet camera is it has a horizontal change which permits you to modify the field of view 1000% better than a camera without a horizontal adjustment. No idea why more bullet cameras do not have this extremely essential function. Also good metal building. Needed to hold the button down for 5 seconds to the left to get correct mode not in white and black. Had to make the wire hole a little larger to fit the huge selection device into the wall. Need to be a better method to execute that. But it was simply a little notch so not a deal breaker. Excellent resolution - much better field of view vs the stock annke cameras and better clarity at night. Ideally these hold up over the years! Highly suggest.</p>
<p>The Wisenet SmartCam N2 provides free perks like person detection, familiar-face signals, and local storage on a microSD card. (Cloud storage starts at $5 per month.) However, in our tests the familiar-face notifies worked just about 50 percent of the time and the camera routinely detached from the network numerous times a day (when everything else on our network seemed fine).
