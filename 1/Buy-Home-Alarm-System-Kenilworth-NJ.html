The crucial distinction with this bullet camera is it has a horizontal change which permits you to modify the field of vision 1000% better than a camera without a horizontal modification. No idea why more bullet cameras do not have this really important function. Also nice metal building. Had to hold the button down for 5 seconds to the left to get correct mode not in black and white. Had to make the wire hole a little larger to fit the huge selection gadget into the wall. Should be a much better way to execute that. But it was simply a little notch so not an offer breaker. Very good resolution - far better field of vision vs the stock annke cameras and far better clarity in the evening. Hopefully these hold up throughout the years! Highly advise.</p>
