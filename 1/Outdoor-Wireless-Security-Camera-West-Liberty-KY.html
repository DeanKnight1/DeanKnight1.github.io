<p>So, while alarm systems might have some benefit for alarm owners as part of a general security package, the question stays whether non-alarm owners in the neighborhood should take on a share of the cost. If alarm use resulted in enhanced public safety-- that is, alarms caused much greater burglar apprehension rates or, preferably, fewer robberies throughout a whole jurisdiction-- its public value would be more evident. Nevertheless, the reality that alarm calls are overwhelmingly incorrect and do not contribute considerably to cops ability to apprehend intruders makes the underwriting of alarm reaction by cops and entire communities (all taxpayers subsidize authorities reaction to alarmed residential or commercial properties) a inefficient and expensive approach to burglary reduction across a whole jurisdiction.</p>
