<p>Although 360 ° and 720 ° cameras may have the exact same resolution specification as that of a basic IP camera, that resolution is being spread over a much wider location and therefore provides less pixels per inch. Here is what this implies, by method of an example. Presume 2 cameras, one a standard camera with a 130 ° field of view and the other a 720 ° camera, and both cameras are high-resolution 10MP (megapixel) models. This suggests the 720 ° camera has far less resolution per square inch; it is beginning with the exact same image sensor, 10MP in this case, though it has to spread out that image across a far bigger space and therefore will not look as crisp of a camera that only has a 130 ° field of vision.</p>
<p>Commercial-grade cameras solve this problem with a special light-handling function. These cameras utilize both a software and hardware option called HDR, which represent High Dynamic Variety". In our example here, HDR takes a direct exposure of the room and an exposure of the doorway and after that combines the 2 images together to develop a properly-exposed composite image of the 2 areas. As far as anybody is concerned, the image looks entirely typical given that the entrance and space appear to be at the exact same brightness level. As a result, faces are correctly exposed at the door and in the shop, achieving the objective of catching video of everyone getting in the shop. HDR is now a basic feature in commercial cameras. Unfortunately, when customers recognize that the inexpensive consumer camera they purchased is doing not have HDR, it's generally too late because the cameras and recorders are installed.</p>

Digital video makers claim that turning CCTV installations into digital video setups is naturally much better).</p>
<p>It would be simple to roll your eyes at this last point, but it suggests you can ask your home security camera for the weather forecast - or whatever Google search takes your fancy - and a speaker within the unit will reply.
