<p>The growing existence of public cameras will bring subtle however profound changes to the character of our public areas. When residents are being enjoyed by the authorities - or aware they may be viewed at any time - they are more self-conscious and less free-wheeling. As syndicated writer Jacob Sullum has actually mentioned, "understanding that you are being seen by armed government representatives tends to deter things. You do not want to upset them or otherwise call attention to yourself." Ultimately, he warns, "people may find out to be careful about the books and periodicals they read in public, preventing titles that may alarm unseen observers.
