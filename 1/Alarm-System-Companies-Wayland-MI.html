Professional installation services might cost up to $250, although special offers that waive installation costs prevail. Find out more about professional installation services here.</p>
<p>As for how to use one, they work the same as the majority of other security cameras and hook into your existing doorbell setup. Sometimes you don't even need to hardwire them, depending on which model you choose. As with any security system, the more equipment you include, the costlier it gets. And that price jumps a lot when you add smart cameras to any Blue system. We like that you can pick from indoor, outdoor, and doorbell cameras, however every smart camera Blue offers is $200.</p>

<p>The Arlo Pro 3 is good but not terrific-- therefore it isn't worth paying two times the price of its predecessor. When the 2 are compared side by side, the Arlo Pro 3 does edge out the Pro 2 on battery life and image, with 2K HDR video that is sharper throughout day and nighttime watching. However, color night vision image quality is disappointing, and the motion tracking function is a bit wonky. Likewise, the Pro 3 uses no totally free storage, and external storage can't be viewed through the app, only by means of a computer system. We will keep monitoring the Arlo Pro 3, however for now, we still think the Arlo Pro 2 is a much better buy. Both are still much better than the pricey Arlo Ultra, which we found to have awful night-vision performance, bad battery life, and a tendency to miss far a lot of motion sets off.</p>
