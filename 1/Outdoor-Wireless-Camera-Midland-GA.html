<p>Commercial-grade cameras resolve this problem with an unique light-handling feature. These cameras use both a software and hardware service called HDR, which stand for High Dynamic Range". In our example here, HDR takes an exposure of the space and a direct exposure of the doorway and after that integrates the 2 images together to develop a properly-exposed composite picture of the two areas. As far as anybody is concerned, the image looks totally regular since the doorway and space seem at the same brightness level.
