<p>Some alarm systems allow you to arm and deactivate from your mobile phone. That's a practical feature, but it doesn't remove the need for a minimum of one keypad arming station.

<p>When motion is discovered, almost all outdoor security cameras are equipped with a motion sensor that will set off the camera to tape-record video. The sensor can also start a push alert to your phone when activity is happening, and some will likewise create an e-mail alert. For an additional layer of security, search for a camera with sound detection that can let you understand if someone is out there even if they run out range of the camera lens and the motion sensing unit. Fair caution: You'll most likely need to modify the sound sensitivity settings to avoid alerts from barking dogs, loud cars, and other random sounds.</p>
<p>The problem with the small, set LED IR cameras is the plastic used in front of the lens and in some cases, the actual lens. After a few years in the harsher environments, this plastic tends to fade and end up being milky. This makes it tough for the CCD or CMOS sensor to successfully equate the imagery, and if there's a series of LED IR lights surrounding the lens, it can trigger a halo-like affect that blurs the image day and night. Inside, these devices have a far longer life span, but outdoors, or even in a garage without environment control, a number of them lose their sharpness and clearness succumbing to the harsh environment.</p>

<p>Closed circuit tv (CCTV) surveillance is a kind of situational crime avoidance developed to avoid both personal and home crime and can be utilized in place of, or in addition to, authorities. Public surveillance cameras monitor, record, and transmit pictures of a particular location of interest and are either monitored remotely by security personnel or preprogramed to scan the specified area (La Vigne et al. 2011). It is thought that the increased surveillance supplied by CCTV will lower crime and boost arrest, without displacing criminal offense to other neighboring areas where CCTV is not in usage (Ratcliffe 2009).</p>
<p>I apologize to all the Wink fans out there, but to call Wink Lookout a security system is a stretch. Lookout is actually simply an excellent name for a set that consists of a Wink smart home hub and a few security oriented sensors. You can't disarm the system and arm. Rather, you turn signals on and off. As you can't disarm it, it can't do things that a normal self-monitored system can do like set off a camera to record or activate the siren.
