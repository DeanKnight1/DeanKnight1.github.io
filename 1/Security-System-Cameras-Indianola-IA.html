<p>The Canary is among the largest cameras we evaluated, and it offers two-way interaction with its paid Canary Membership. The rate of the Canary View makes the size a bit more palatable, however the image isn't as sharp, and recording wasn't constant during our screening. The Netatmo Welcome does not have two-way audio or digital zoom, and it constantly asked us to acknowledge already-identified faces. And in spite of having an attractive rate and good performance, the Yi 1080p Home Camera has confusing cloud storage that adds $65 to $150 each year to the cost of an otherwise spending plan camera.</p>
<p>The Arlo Pro 3 is good but not fantastic-- and so it isn't worth paying two times the rate of its predecessor. When the two are compared side by side, the Arlo Pro 3 does edge out the Pro 2 on battery life and image, with 2K HDR video that is sharper throughout day and nighttime watching. However, color night vision image quality is disappointing, and the motion tracking feature is a bit wonky. Also, the Pro 3 uses no complimentary storage, and external storage can't be viewed through the app, just via a computer. We will keep monitoring the Arlo Pro 3, however for now, we still believe the Arlo Pro 2 is a much better buy. Both are still much better than the costly Arlo Ultra, which we discovered to have dreadful night-vision efficiency, bad battery life, and a propensity to miss out on far a lot of motion triggers.</p>
