ADT is among the more expensive home security companies, with high-priced video monitoring and steep early termination charges. However ADT is known to offer deals that reduce the cost of equipment, that makes the general cost for a 36-month contract a lot more reasonable.</p>

They connect to the company's respective app, so you're constantly in the know. Frontpoint's flood sensing units cost simply $44.99 and provide 3 to five times more variety than ADT's and Vivint's.

<p>Neither the light nor the camera is particularly impressive on its own. The Maximus Smart Security Light camera is HD, however it's only 720p-- and we're starting to anticipate 1080p, if not 4K, from the security camera market. With that said, we would not recommend this system to tech-lovers, as we think the features are a little too basic. For example, we would have liked to see an outdoor camera and more clever home features. But if easy DIY installation, no-contracts, and low-priced monitoring is your thing, we think you'll love SimpliSafe.</p>
