Another location where Arlo stands out is customer care.

Since it does not have wires that can be cut, it likewise makes your camera more tamper-proof. Unfortunately I bought 4 cameras that look much like these, thinking I was going to save $14.00 per camera for the same camera. Kid was I incorrect!! These cameras are true 1080p and work completely right out of package. They are well lined up and focused. The clarity is actually fantastic. Night vision holds true 1080p at around 40ft, but still can see pretty good after that. These cameras are what you need to buy, and do not go cheap.</p>
