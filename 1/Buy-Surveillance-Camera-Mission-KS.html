<p>Get best-in-class security, plus clever home automation the entire household will love. ADT is a household name, so we often try their systems to ensure they're still up-to-task. In our most current round of screening, we understood that ADT is the most popular provider for a reason. We believe their home protection + home automation + video packages are nipping at the heels of Vivint. That is, they made us feel secure in our home and kept us plenty busy with cool wise home functions. We specifically liked the ADT Pulse App and controls.</p>
<p>It's becoming more popular. But for the time being, if you see an outdoor camera that provides two-way audio, go all out. Tenants and others who are not exactly sure for how long they will be remaining in their existing house must prevent entering into long-lasting agreements. Nevertheless, an exception can be made for home security systems that feature advantages like the ADT Mover's Savings Bundle, which permit you to take your equipment to a new home. This likewise depends on the provider, however you can expect signing an agreement with suppliers who require professional installation of their systems. The average length of a home security agreement is 36 months or 3 years. On the greater end, some contracts might cover approximately 60 months or 5 years. We would recommend considering a Do It Yourself home security system instead if you desire to avoid having to sign an agreement.</p>

Allied Home Security can install a new system or trigger an existing system in your home.
