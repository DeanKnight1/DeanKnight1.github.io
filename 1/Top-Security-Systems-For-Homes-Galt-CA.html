The Wyze Webcam can also capture video to the cloud, however the free account is restricted to 12-second clips every 5 minutes. That suggests the camera will wait 5 minutes before it has the ability to tape-record once again, which suggests you might be missing a lot. Wyze's recently released Complete Motion Capture solves this issue for $1.50 monthly per camera. It makes it possible for recording of all motion the camera senses, for as much as 5 minutes in a row. If motion continues beyond that window, the camera ends one clip and quickly starts another, with no gaps in between. Recordings are simple to discover under the Occasions tab at the bottom of the app. Without the membership, you still get the minimal cloud recording and microSD recording, but we do not advise that for home security since if it's taken, you do not have a backup.</p>
