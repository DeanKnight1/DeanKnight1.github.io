The crucial difference with this bullet camera is it has a horizontal adjustment which enables you to tweak the field of view 1000% much better than a camera without a horizontal change. No clue why more bullet cameras do not have this very important function. Also great metal building. Had to hold the button down for 5 seconds to the left to get right mode not in white and black. Needed to make the wire hole a little bigger to fit the substantial selection gadget into the wall. Should be a much better way to implement that.
