<p>Establishing a secure and safe environment for a commercial or residential property is the duty of the whole neighborhood. Storage capability: For video recorders, the first concern you need to ask yourself is how much storage you will need. The response hinges on a couple of aspects: the number of cameras in your system, each camera's resolution, the amount of archived video footage you plan to store and for how long you plan to keep taped video. If there are many cameras shooting in a higher resolution, the video is going to consume storage space rapidly.

<p>Essentially, a wireless security system is comprised of alarms, sensing units, cameras, and different detectors all connected to a primary control panel through radio signals. For instance, a four-camera system that runs 24 hr a day using IP cameras, each with a 2-megapixel resolution and a frame rate of 5 fps, with video compressed into MJPEG files on a NVR, would require 2.79 terabytes of storage space for video, according to the Supercircuits calculator.</p>
