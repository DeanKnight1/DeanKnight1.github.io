<p>The growing existence of public cameras will bring profound but subtle changes to the character of our public spaces.

As syndicated columnist Jacob Sullum has actually mentioned, "knowing that you are being watched by armed federal government representatives tends to deter things. You do not wish to anger them or otherwise call attention to yourself." Ultimately, he warns, "individuals might find out to be careful about the regulars and books they check out in public, preventing titles that might alarm unseen observers. They may also put more believed into how they dress, lest they look like terrorists, gang members, hookers or druggies."
