<p>When I discuss my work with homeland security surveillance and physical security technologies, I generally get the Big Brother is watching" comment, referring to George Orwell's omnipresent socialistic watcher called Big Brother in his book 1984. This Orwellian" worry is that somebody someplace may be enjoying you through a video surveillance camera this really minute and that someone somewhere is abusing the system to breach your freedom and personal privacy.

Without being able to see a visual verification, you will either have to rush back home just to find an incorrect alarm or you'll have to contact your neighbors, buddies, or household to check in.</p>

<p>Are you in a home with a pre-wired security system? If so, having a hardwired security system installed may be a simpler and more affordable option.

The more megapixels a camera sensor has, the more you can digitally zoom in and still have the ability to see things clearly.</p>
