Without being able to see a visual verification, you will either have to rush back home just to find an incorrect alarm or you'll have to contact your neighbors, buddies, or household to check in.</p>

The more megapixels a camera sensor has, the more you can digitally zoom in and still have the ability to see things clearly.</p>
