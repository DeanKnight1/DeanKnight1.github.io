<p>3 huge advantages of wireless security systems for tenants are their expandability, impermanence and portability. Occupants, unlike property owners, generally avoid making long-term modifications to their homes.

On the other hand, wireless security uses equipment that's either freestanding or attached to walls and entranceways with removable adhesive. Wireless control panels, sensing units and other components can quickly be set up at different residential or commercial properties later on, and wireless systems are easily broadened with new components too.

Sadly I bought 4 cameras that look much like these, believing I was going to conserve $14.00 per camera for the same camera. Young boy was I wrong!! These cameras are true 1080p and work perfectly right out of package. They are well lined up and focused. The clarity is really terrific. Night vision holds true 1080p at around 40ft, but still can see pretty good after that. These cameras are what you require to buy, and do not go cheap.</p>
