<p>I simply ended up updating all of my stock annke cameras with this design. The essential difference with this bullet camera is it has a horizontal adjustment which permits you to modify the field of view 1000% much better than a camera without a horizontal modification. No idea why more bullet cameras do not have this extremely essential function. Likewise great metal building. Had to hold the button down for 5 seconds to the delegated get right mode not in white and black. Had to make the wire hole a little larger to fit the huge selection gadget into the wall. Need to be a much better way to execute that. However it was just a little notch so not an offer breaker.
