<p>No matter what kind of alarm you have, most burglar alarms work the exact same method. They utilize open and closed circuits to transfer an electrical present. When this electrical current is not being moved it sets off a burglar alarm. In closed circuit security systems, the electrical current is moved when the doors are shut. Which suggests if the doors are shut electrical current can be transferred throughout the circuits. If someone were to unlock that would suggest that the electrical current can no longer be moved, which would then trigger the alarm system. Nevertheless, in an open circuit security system, unlocking allows for the electrical current to stream throughout the system, which suggests when the doors are shut the alarm system will activate.</p>
