<p>Thank you for your feedback, Don. We have actually found that battery life never matches the producer's stats since this originates from tests in a controlled environment without constant video recording, which is the greatest perpetrator for short battery life without a doubt. We concur with you about Blink's superior battery life over on our outdoor security camera review, however its recording capacity is a bit minimal to recommend as a top pick.</p>
