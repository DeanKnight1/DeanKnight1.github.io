The exact same is true of high-resolution TV sets, and the two most popular TELEVISION resolutions today are 1080p and 4K. 4K resolution includes about 4 times as much image details as 1080p. Surveillance cameras are also manufactured in these 2 resolutions, and it would be natural to think that the more dots in your video image the better, right? Yes and no. When it comes to surveillance cameras, there are some difficult repercussions to having such a high-resolution 4K image. In this case, more is not constantly much better.</p>
