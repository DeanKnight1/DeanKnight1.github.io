<p>ADT authorized provider SafeStreets charges a $99 (or more) installation cost, but the brand name doesn't otherwise charge up front for a system it states is worth $1,300. The equipment's all supplied by 3rd parties, so what you receive may be from a different producer than the equipment your neighbor got. Why's that? ADT uses an independent supplier model involving third-party dealers. The dealerships figure out which equipment to use. Costs for systems differ. Bigger systems that provide full-house coverage with expert monitoring are the most costly alternatives. Smaller sized, self-monitored systems are the most economical choice.</p>
<p>The Arlo Pro 3 is not excellent but good-- and so it isn't worth paying twice the cost of its predecessor. When the two are compared side by side, the Arlo Pro 3 does edge out the Pro 2 on battery life and image, with 2K HDR video that is sharper throughout day and nighttime watching. Nevertheless, color night vision image quality is frustrating, and the motion tracking function is a bit wonky. Likewise, the Pro 3 uses no free storage, and external storage can't be seen through the app, only through a computer. We will keep monitoring the Arlo Pro 3, but for now, we still believe the Arlo Pro 2 is a much better buy. Both are still much better than the pricey Arlo Ultra, which we discovered to have awful night-vision efficiency, poor battery life, and a tendency to miss far too many motion triggers.</p>
