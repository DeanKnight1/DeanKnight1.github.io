These security cameras link to a user's home wifi network and enables that user to see the video from anywhere. A common misconception is that wireless means the camera is wire-free.

If the doors are shut electrical current can be transferred throughout the circuits, which means. Which would then set off the burglar alarm if somebody were to open the door that would mean that the electrical current can no longer be transferred.
