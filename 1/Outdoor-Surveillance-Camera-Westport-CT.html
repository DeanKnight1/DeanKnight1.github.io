It also makes your camera more tamper-proof because it doesn't have wires that can be cut. Unfortunately I acquired 4 cameras that look similar to these, believing I was going to save $14.00 per camera for the same camera. Young boy was I wrong!! These cameras hold true 1080p and work completely right out of the box. They are well aligned and focused. The clearness is really fantastic.
