<p>Commercial-grade cameras solve this issue with an unique light-handling feature. These cameras utilize both a software application and hardware solution called HDR, which stand for High Dynamic Range". In our example here, HDR takes a direct exposure of the room and a direct exposure of the doorway and after that combines the 2 images together to create a properly-exposed composite picture of the 2 locations. As far as anybody is concerned, the image looks entirely normal because the entrance and room appear to be at the exact same brightness level. As an outcome, faces are correctly exposed at the door and in the shop, accomplishing the objective of capturing video of everyone getting in the shop. HDR is now a standard feature in commercial cameras. Regrettably, when clients understand that the affordable customer camera they bought is lacking HDR, it's typically too late considering that the recorders and cameras are installed.</p>

Does the camera store to an SD card, which you'll require to by hand remove to transfer the data? Does it go to your smart device, or upload to services like Dropbox? For the best security, you want the information to be supported in several locations. Another factor is how many days of video footage are archived.
