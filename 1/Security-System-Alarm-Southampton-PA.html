<p>I just completed upgrading all of my stock annke cameras with this model. The crucial distinction with this bullet camera is it has a horizontal adjustment which enables you to fine-tune the field of vision 1000% much better than a camera without a horizontal adjustment. No hint why more bullet cameras do not have this extremely crucial function. Also great metal construction. Needed to hold the button down for 5 seconds to the left to get right mode not in black and white. Needed to make the wire hole a little larger to fit the huge choice gadget into the wall. Should be a much better way to execute that. But it was just a little notch so not a deal breaker. Very good resolution - far better field of vision vs the stock annke cameras and much better clearness during the night. Hopefully these hold up throughout the years! Extremely recommend.</p>

<p>When looking at a normal camera image, you would be hard-pressed to inform the difference in between 1080p and 4K resolution. The one significant advantage of 4K resolution is the capability to deal with detail after the reality, which means that users can zoom in on information such as faces while the recording of a security event plays. Nevertheless, while 4K resolution offers some benefits, it also brings with it some drawbacks. 4K images are large and use up a great deal of recording storage area. So much, in reality, that they need about 4 times the disk drive space of 1080p to tape the exact same length of video footage.
