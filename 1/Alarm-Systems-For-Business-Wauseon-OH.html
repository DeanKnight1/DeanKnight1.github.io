The most recent Arlo, the Arlo Ultra, is pricey, but it pumps images approximately 4K resolution and has a great daytime image. In our screening, however, we discovered the motion sensing unit to be sensitive, with dreadful night-vision performance, and wonky tracking and bad battery life to boot. We are confirming with Arlo whether our system was defective, therefore we might revisit this review. Essentially, the Nest camera sits anywhere you put it and records what it sees, saving the last 5 days of video to the cloud. The wide face of the camera offers you an outstanding visual field, and the image you get is of good quality (you can change the resolution; the much better it gets, the more data you'll utilize to wait to the cloud.)

<p>The Arlo Pro 3 is good however not terrific-- therefore it isn't worth paying two times the cost of its predecessor. When the two are compared side by side, the Arlo Pro 3 does edge out the Pro 2 on battery life and image, with 2K HDR video that is sharper throughout day and nighttime watching. Nevertheless, color night vision image quality is frustrating, and the motion tracking function is a bit wonky. Also, the Pro 3 offers no complimentary storage, and external storage can't be viewed through the app, just through a computer. We will keep monitoring the Arlo Pro 3, but for now, we still believe the Arlo Pro 2 is a much better buy. Both are still better than the pricey Arlo Ultra, which we discovered to have terrible night-vision efficiency, poor battery life, and a tendency to miss far too many motion triggers.</p>
