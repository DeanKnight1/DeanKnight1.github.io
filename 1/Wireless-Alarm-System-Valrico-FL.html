Here's how it plays out: First you need to put and download the app in your e-mail address. Then you enter the WiFi information of the network you're attempting to connect to. Then the phone plays a piercing, electronic acoustic wave to the camera to transfer the WiFi details. (You must play this at full volume or it won't work). Windows smash, pets groan, cats scream, babies weep. Not that you can hear; your ear drums will have burst in the first 10 seconds. It does not work. And it never works.</p>
<p>The issue with the small, set LED IR cameras is the plastic utilized in front of the lens and in many cases, the real lens. After a few years in the harsher climates, this plastic tends to fade and end up being milky.

Inside your home, these gadgets have a far longer life span, but outdoors, or perhaps in a garage without environment control, a lot of them lose their sharpness and clearness catching the harsh environment.</p>
