Due to the fact that it comes with multiple door and window sensing units for full coverage, we advise the eight-piece package. We also advise including a doorbell camera at some time.

Although there are a range of additional system parts readily available including smoke alarm and wireless security cameras, the basic alarm includes three main elements: a keypad control board, private sensing units, and a manned monitoring station.</p>
