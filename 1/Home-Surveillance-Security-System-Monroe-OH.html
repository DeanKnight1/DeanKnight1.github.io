<p>The growing existence of public cameras will bring profound but subtle modifications to the character of our public spaces. When residents are being enjoyed by the authorities - or mindful they may be watched at any time - they are more uneasy and less free-wheeling.

You don't want to offend them or otherwise call attention to yourself." Eventually, he alerts, "people might discover to be mindful about the regulars and books they check out in public, avoiding titles that might alarm unseen observers.
