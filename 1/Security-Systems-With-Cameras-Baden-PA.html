<p>I just ended up upgrading all of my stock annke cameras with this model. The key difference with this bullet camera is it has a horizontal adjustment which enables you to fine-tune the field of view 1000% much better than a camera without a horizontal change. No hint why more bullet cameras do not have this very essential function. Also great metal construction. Had to hold the button down for 5 seconds to the delegated get appropriate mode not in black and white. Had to make the wire hole a little bigger to fit the big choice device into the wall. Should be a better way to carry out that. But it was simply a little notch so not an offer breaker. Excellent resolution - far better field of vision vs the stock annke cameras and much better clarity during the night. Ideally these hold up throughout the years! Highly advise.</p>

<p>The remainder of the field is more specialized, dealing with sophisticated smart home aficionados or fans of a specific ecosytem of products. Nest's Secure has the very best design of any system I evaluated, consisting of smart things like integrating a motion and the keypad detector into the base station and combining motion detectors and entry sensors into one unit.
