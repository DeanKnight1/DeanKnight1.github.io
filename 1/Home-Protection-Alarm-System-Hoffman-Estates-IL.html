<h3>Wireless Monitored Home Security System in Illinois</h3>

<p>The Wi-Fi Protected Gain Access To (WPA and WPA2) security procedures were later produced to address the issues with WEP. If a weak password, such as a dictionary word or short character string is utilized, WPA and WPA2 can be cracked. Using a long enough random password (e.g. 14 random letters) or passphrase (e.g. 5 arbitrarily selected words) makes pre-shared key WPA virtually uncrackable. The second generation of the WPA security protocol (WPA2) is based on the final IEEE 802.11 i modification to the 802.11 requirement and is qualified for FIPS 140-2 compliance.

Once the signal is gotten, the intruder alarm will wait to send out another message if another zone is tripped. Getting in the code on the alarm system's keypad and turning off the system will end this process with the ADT monitoring center.</p>
