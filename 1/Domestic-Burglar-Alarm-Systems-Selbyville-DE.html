<p>I simply completed updating all of my stock annke cameras with this model. The key distinction with this bullet camera is it has a horizontal adjustment which allows you to tweak the field of view 1000% better than a camera without a horizontal modification.

Had to hold the button down for 5 seconds to the left to get proper mode not in white and black. Needed to make the wire hole a little bigger to fit the huge choice gadget into the wall. Must be a better way to execute that. However it was just a little notch so not a deal breaker. Excellent resolution - far better field of vision vs the stock annke cameras and much better clearness during the night. Hopefully these hold up for many years! Highly suggest.</p>
