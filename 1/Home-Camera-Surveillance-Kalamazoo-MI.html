<p>C. False Burglar Alarm. Make the purchase online for UL Central Station Alarm Monitoring. Select either landline or the correct interactive service if utilizing 4G LTE cellular or IP Internet. Select billing duration: Month-to-month or Yearly. We get a 15% prepay discount rate from our UL main station provider which we pass on to our yearly clients. This is NOT an agreement, rather an annual prepay discount rate. When I ultimately entered the camera controls, I was reasonably impressed. The camera quality isn't half bad, there's a solid night-vision mode, and all the app controls are fairly obvious. You've got two-way audio, you can play melodies just to let the individual being viewed understand they're being viewed, and you can select to tape-record video clips or pictures and save them to your wise device on a whim.</p>
