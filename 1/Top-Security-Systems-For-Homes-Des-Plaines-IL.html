<p>The growing presence of public cameras will bring subtle but profound changes to the character of our public spaces. When residents are being watched by the authorities - or aware they might be enjoyed at any time - they are more uneasy and less free-wheeling. As syndicated columnist Jacob Sullum has actually mentioned, "knowing that you are being watched by armed government agents tends to put a damper on things. You do not wish to offend them or otherwise call attention to yourself." Ultimately, he warns, "people might learn to be mindful about the books and regulars they read in public, preventing titles that might alarm hidden observers. They might likewise put more thought into how they dress, lest they appear like terrorists, gang drug addicts, hookers or members."
