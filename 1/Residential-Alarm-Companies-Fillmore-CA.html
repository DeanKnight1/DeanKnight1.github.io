Wyze's recently introduced Total Motion Capture solves this problem for $1.50 monthly per camera. It makes it possible for recording of all motion the camera senses, for up to five minutes in a row. If motion continues beyond that window, the camera ends one clip and instantly begins another, without any spaces in between. Recordings are simple to find under the Events tab at the bottom of the app. Without the subscription, you still get the minimal cloud recording and microSD recording, however we do not suggest that for home security due to the fact that if it's stolen, you don't have a backup.</p>
