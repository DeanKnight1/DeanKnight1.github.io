<p>Nurse calling systems normally include emergency buttons or pull strings within the patient's bathroom. If a patient is having difficulty, he can press the button or pull the string and it will send out an alert to the nurse station. This is a basic switch that is usually open or typically closed. The majority of your commercial security cameras include dry contact input ports to integrate alarms and notifies, sensing units, gain access to control, and so on.

<p>SimpliSafe may be too limited for you if you have a larger home or property you want to keep an eye on. The only outdoor security camera that's presently readily available is the Video Doorbell Pro, which is excellent for watching on visitors and package deliveries, but it leaves other parts of your yard vulnerable.
