Although recording video footage of your facility is an essential method to ensure security, it acts as evidence after the inappropriate activity has actually happened. But in order to be able to actively change outcomes, it's a good idea to monitor video surveillance.</p>
<p>This cool wise alarm has a motion detector and siren in one device.
