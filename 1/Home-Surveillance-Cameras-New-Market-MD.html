This suggests the 720 ° camera has far less resolution per square inch; it is beginning with the same image sensor, 10MP in this case, though it needs to spread out that image across a far larger area and for that reason will not look as crisp of a camera that just has a 130 ° field of view.</p>

Although some companies offer greatly discounted or totally free hardware in exchange for a service dedication that can last anywhere from one to 5 years, we found no-contract systems to be the most flexible.
