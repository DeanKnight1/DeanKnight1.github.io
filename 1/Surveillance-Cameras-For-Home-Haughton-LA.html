We truly took pleasure in using Brinks' video features, and we like how their top-tier plan comes with an HD video doorbell for good measure.</p>
<p>I simply completed upgrading all of my stock annke cameras with this model. The crucial difference with this bullet camera is it has a horizontal modification which permits you to modify the field of view 1000% much better than a camera without a horizontal modification. No idea why more bullet cameras do not have this very essential function. Likewise great metal construction. Had to hold the button down for 5 seconds to the left to get correct mode not in black and white. Needed to make the wire hole a little bigger to fit the substantial choice gadget into the wall. Need to be a much better way to execute that. However it was simply a little notch so not a deal breaker. Very good resolution - better field of view vs the stock annke cameras and better clearness during the night. Ideally these hold up over the years! Extremely advise.</p>
