Rather, when you link a PoE switch to your network, you've got a source of power and a method of sending information to your NVR all in one bundle.

The Maximus Smart Security Light camera is HD, however it's just 720p-- and we're starting to anticipate 1080p, if not 4K, from the security camera industry.
