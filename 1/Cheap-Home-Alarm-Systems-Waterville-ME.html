<p>CCTV surveillance equipment is a deterrent versus vandalism, theft, and fraud. Suggestion: Typically keyholders are not readily available and the alarm does not reset. We should again respond to the alarm; each response is billed if the alarm is malfunctioning and reactivates. Having a keyholder offered to reset the alarm is one way of getting rid of expensive false alarms. For instance, if the carbon monoxide levels increase past a specific level, you can make it immediately turn off the heating unit. If the motion sensors are set off, you can instantly make the clever lights turn on to scare away prospective burglars.</p>
