The key difference with this bullet camera is it has a horizontal adjustment which permits you to tweak the field of vision 1000% better than a camera without a horizontal modification. No clue why more bullet cameras do not have this extremely important function. Likewise good metal construction. Needed to hold the button down for 5 seconds to the left to get correct mode not in black and white. Had to make the wire hole a little bigger to fit the big choice device into the wall. Must be a much better method to carry out that. But it was just a little notch so not a deal breaker. Great resolution - better field of vision vs the stock annke cameras and far better clarity during the night. Ideally these hold up for many years! Extremely recommend.</p>
