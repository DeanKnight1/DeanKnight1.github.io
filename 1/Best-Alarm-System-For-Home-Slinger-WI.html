<p>CCTV surveillance equipment is a deterrent versus theft, fraud, and vandalism. Idea: Frequently keyholders are not readily available and the alarm does not reset. We need to again react to the alarm; each response is billed if the alarm is malfunctioning and reactivates. Having a keyholder available to reset the alarm is one method of removing costly incorrect alarms. For instance, if the carbon monoxide gas levels increase past a specific level, you can make it instantly shut off the heating systems.
