<p>I just finished upgrading all of my stock annke cameras with this model. The key distinction with this bullet camera is it has a horizontal adjustment which permits you to tweak the field of vision 1000% much better than a camera without a horizontal modification. No idea why more bullet cameras do not have this very essential function. Likewise great metal construction. Had to hold the button down for 5 seconds to the left to get correct mode not in black and white. Needed to make the wire hole a little bigger to fit the big choice device into the wall. Should be a much better way to implement that. However it was just a little notch so not an offer breaker. Excellent resolution - better field of view vs the stock annke cameras and much better clarity at night. Hopefully these hold up over the years! Extremely advise.</p>
