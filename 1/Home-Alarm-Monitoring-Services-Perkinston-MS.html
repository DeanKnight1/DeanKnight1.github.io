<p>The real factor cameras are normally released is to lower much pettier criminal activities. But it has actually not even been shown that they can do that. In Britain, where cameras have been thoroughly released in public locations, sociologists studying the problem have found that they have not reduced criminal offense. "When the crime and offence figures were gotten used to take account of the general downward pattern in offenses and criminal activities," criminologists found in one research study, "decreases were noted in certain categories however there was no proof to suggest that the cameras had actually reduced crime overall in the city centre." A 2005 study for the British Home Office also discovered that cameras did not cut criminal offense or the worry of crime (as had a 2002 study, also for the British government).</p>
