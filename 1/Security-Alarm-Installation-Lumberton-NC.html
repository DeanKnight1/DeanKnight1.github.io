It's an argument that's often skewed by aspects such as hesitation over the susceptibility of wireless systems, including interference from radio signals and problems that cause false alarms. While improvements over the last few years have actually made the innovation more popular and robust (some systems today have their own distinct wireless innovation, which can't be interfered with by other signals), issues persist over vulnerabilities that don't affect hardwired systems.</p>
<p>Almost all outdoor security cameras are geared up with a motion sensor that will activate the camera to tape-record video when motion is detected. The sensor can also initiate a push alert to your phone when activity is taking place, and some will also produce an e-mail alert. For an extra layer of security, search for a camera with sound detection that can let you understand if somebody is out there even if they're out of series of the camera lens and the motion sensing unit.
