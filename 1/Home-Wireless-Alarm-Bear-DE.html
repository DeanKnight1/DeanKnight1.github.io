In our example here, HDR takes a direct exposure of the space and a direct exposure of the doorway and then integrates the two images together to produce a properly-exposed composite image of the two locations. As far as anybody is concerned, the image looks completely normal since the doorway and space appear to be at the same brightness level. As an outcome, faces are correctly exposed at the door and in the shop, accomplishing the goal of catching video of everybody entering the store. HDR is now a standard feature in commercial cameras.
