This is likewise referred to as the logical choice theory (La Vigne et al. 2011). CCTV is likewise grounded in situational criminal activity avoidance strategy, which argues that opportunities to upset can be reduced by modifying a range of mechanisms such as increasing the risk of an offender being captured, increasing the effort to commit the criminal offense, decreasing rewards from criminal offense commission, and minimizing justifications that give rise to criminal chances (La Vigne et al. 2011).
