Individuals feel much safer in the knowledge that a potential thug or assailant will be put-off by the presence of a camera. Wireless home security systems use cellular monitoring, which is the innovation used to communicate with the alarm monitoring center. This innovation is quickly becoming the preferred choice by homeowner's due to it being the most trustworthy connection along with offering much better protection from tampering.</p>
<p>Unlike a lot of other cameras we checked, the corded Circle 2 does not have level of sensitivity settings for motion detection (though the cordless model does ). Rather, you can filter event notifications only by high activity, days, or individual (the latter is offered only with a paid Circle Safe membership). Without a paid Circle Safe membership, you'll get more informs, which you can just filter to receive every minute, 15 minutes, or 30 minutes. The membership is more useful when used in high-traffic locations. Otherwise, the Smart Location function can be set to disable recording when you're home-- to prevent informs whenever you walk by. Strangely, though the app supports several users, its geofencing applies to each user separately, so if everyone in your household has the Circle app installed, you'll still get notices when other people are home.</p>
