<p>Closed circuit tv (CCTV) surveillance is a type of situational criminal offense avoidance designed to prevent both personal and residential or commercial property crime and can be utilized in location of, or in addition to, police. Public surveillance cameras monitor, record, and transfer images of a particular area of interest and are either monitored from another location by security personnel or preprogramed to scan the specified location (La Vigne et al. 2011). It is believed that the increased surveillance provided by CCTV will reduce criminal offense and boost arrest, without displacing crime to other close-by areas where CCTV is not in usage (Ratcliffe 2009).</p>
<p>The integration of digital video surveillance and access control becomes part of the natural merging of security technologies. Centralizing security into a single user interface provides additional information that may never ever have actually been possible before, such as notice of a staff member, by name and identification number, entering the building. A picture of that employee is presented on screen for verification (verifying it's not a taken ID), and, through image capture on the security camera, making sure no tailgating occurs.</p>

<p>Unlike the majority of other cameras we evaluated, the corded Circle 2 does not have level of sensitivity settings for motion detection (though the cordless design does ). Instead, you can filter event notifications only by high activity, days, or individual (the latter is available only with a paid Circle Safe membership). Without a paid Circle Safe membership, you'll get more informs, which you can just filter to get every minute, 15 minutes, or thirty minutes. When utilized in high-traffic areas, the membership is more helpful. Otherwise, the Smart Location function can be set to disable recording when you're home-- to avoid notifies whenever you walk by. Strangely, though the app supports several users, its geofencing uses to each user individually, so if everybody in your household has the Circle app installed, you'll still get notifications when other individuals are home.</p>
