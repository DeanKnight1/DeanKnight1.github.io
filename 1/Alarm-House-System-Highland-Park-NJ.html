The $260 Fundamentals bundle includes the base station, a keypad, 4 entry sensors, one motion sensing unit, a lawn sign, and 2 window decals. For $15 per month, you can add ongoing expert monitoring and a cellular connection, so the system can communicate with the monitoring service without a landline.

<p>Piza and associates (2019) performed a new review of the literature to upgrade a meta-analysis by Welsh and Farrington (2008) that took a look at the impacts of closed-circuit television (CCTV) surveillance on crime prevention. The researchers looked for CCTV assessments published between 2007 and 2017 to account for the duration since the last evaluation (which covered examinations completed in 2006 and earlier). Techniques consisted of searches of electronic bibliographic databases, manual searches of CCTV examination research study bibliographies, forward searches of CCTV examinations, and calling leading researchers to ask about forthcoming evaluations.
