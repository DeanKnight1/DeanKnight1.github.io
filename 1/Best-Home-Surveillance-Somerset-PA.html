<p>The Arlo Pro 3 is not fantastic but good-- therefore it isn't worth paying two times the rate of its predecessor.

Both are still better than the pricey Arlo Ultra, which we found to have awful night-vision efficiency, bad battery life, and a tendency to miss out on far too many motion activates.</p>
