<p>Our CCTV surveillance camera systems are trusted by more than 60,000 companies, universities, and federal government centers, and residential customers. After investigating 4 various security systems, we picked SSA. They provided us the best description of their services and offered us more for the money. After having a bad experience with the local installer for ADT and canceling them, we experienced what a genuinely professional installation ought to be.

<p>Some wireless security service providers have additional features and plans for an added cost. If you  want to have continuous video recording and cloud storage for your security cameras, you'll have to pay a regular monthly or yearly  fee. A lot of these deals do not include an agreement, however some may need a contract for the equipment or professional monitoring services. For example, Scout only provides one security camera (and it's for indoor use just). If you want a few more sets of eyes on your property, however, Scout Alarm integrates with Nest Cams, which can send out motion alerts to your Scout app.</p>

<p>CCTV cameras are much better at capturing crooks after they have dedicated a crime, rather than having the ability to stop a criminal offense in development.

<p>The rest of Nest's security equipment is high-quality, if not especially cutting-edge, so we're really advising the security cameras here.

Sure, you get a lower rate if you go with a three-year agreement, but since Nest requires you to pay 100% of your remaining agreement if you cancel, it's a big commitment. So pick what will be the better deal for you. Go with the contract and gain those savings if you understand you'll remain put for at least 3 years. However if you may upgrade to a new office with various security needs, contract-free is your best bet.</p>
