<p>The Alarm Systems & Intrusion Detection item classification is a collection of news, item listings and other resources for security experts looking into Alarm Systems & Intrusion Detection products. We thought about both the TP-Link Kasa Spot (KC100) and the Kasa Cam (KC120) for among our top areas. Nevertheless, neither model has geofencing, and the KC120 left gaps of up to 25 seconds in between recordings. The Spot can record up to 3 minutes without gaps in between clips, however entries were often missing, in spite of showing up in the app's activity timeline.

<p>Neither the light nor the camera is particularly excellent by itself. The Maximus Smart Security Light camera is HD, but it's just 720p-- and we're starting to anticipate 1080p, if not 4K, from the security camera industry. With that stated, we would not advise this system to tech-lovers, as we believe the functions are a little too basic. For instance, we would have liked to see an outdoor camera and more smart home functions. But if simple DIY installation, no-contracts, and low-priced monitoring is your thing, we believe you'll enjoy SimpliSafe.</p>
