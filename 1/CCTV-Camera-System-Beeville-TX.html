As far as anybody is worried, the image looks completely typical because the doorway and space appear to be at the same brightness level. As an outcome, faces are appropriately exposed at the door and in the shop, accomplishing the goal of capturing video of everyone entering the store. HDR is now a standard feature in commercial cameras. Regrettably, as soon as clients realize that the inexpensive customer camera they bought is lacking HDR, it's usually too late since the cameras and recorders are set up.</p>
