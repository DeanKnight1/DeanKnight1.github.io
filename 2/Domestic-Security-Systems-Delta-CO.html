If the doors are shut electrical current can be moved throughout the circuits, which implies. Which would then set off the burglar alarm if somebody were to open the door that would indicate that the electrical current can no longer be transferred. However, in an open circuit security system, opening the door allows for the electrical existing to stream throughout the system, which suggests when the doors are shut the burglar alarm will trigger.</p>
