In Britain, where cameras have been extensively released in public locations, sociologists studying the problem have discovered that they have not lowered criminal activity. "Once the crime and offense figures were adjusted to appraise the general downward pattern in offences and criminal offenses," criminologists discovered in one study, "decreases were noted in certain classifications however there was no evidence to suggest that the cameras had reduced crime overall in the city centre."
