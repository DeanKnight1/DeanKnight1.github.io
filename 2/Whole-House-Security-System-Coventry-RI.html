<p>Slightly more expensive than our winning wise alarm, this system was almost as easy to install and, throughout testing, the loud, clear siren was quick to sound if among the sensors had been activated. We love that the system consists of a wifi security camera and only alerts you when motion is produced by something with the very same heat pattern as a human (making sure there's no incorrect alerts).

<p>I simply completed upgrading all of my stock annke cameras with this design. The crucial distinction with this bullet camera is it has a horizontal change which permits you to fine-tune the field of vision 1000% better than a camera without a horizontal adjustment. No hint why more bullet cameras do not have this extremely important feature. Likewise great metal building and construction.

Should be a better method to execute that. However it was simply a little notch so not a deal breaker.
