<p>According to a report, homes that do not have a security system are three times more likely to be robbed. If you wish to keep an eye on what's taking place in your house when you're not there, however you don't wish to buy a full-fledged home security system, a Wi-Fi-connected camera deserves a look. These are the best indoor home security cameras in our screening. Aside from great equipment, Frontpoint utilizes 100% wireless equipment utilizing cellular technology. Compared to landline security monitoring, cellular alarm systems are more secure as there are no interruptions even during bad weather condition. Frontpoint knows that the world is now switching to cellular alarm, and they was among the first to use this innovation in all their systems.</p>
<p>Some wireless security providers have extra features and prepare for an added cost. If you  want to have constant video recording and cloud storage for your security cameras, you'll need to pay a annual or monthly fee. A lot of these offers don't consist of a contract, however some might need a contract for the equipment or professional monitoring services.

Let that sink in for a minute ... these companies do not even utilize the kind of cameras they are selling to the general public, and there is a good reason why.</p>
