<p>The NVR eliminates these issues, because it is rather linked straight to a network. IP cameras that are linked to the very same network, generally by way of a PoE switch, are then able to transmit video footage to the NVR. Systems based around an NVR are a lot easier to scale up than DVR systems, just because they can accept a new camera once it is added to the network. In the worst case, all that would be needed is an additional PoE switch. Some IP cameras are also wireless and can transfer video footage to the NVR over Wi-Fi. There are no distance limitations so long as a camera is connected to the same network as the NVR.

For each extra camera, the subscription is discounted to about half of the initial fee. By comparison, Arlo charges $3 each month for individual detection with 1 month of cloud storage, and Logitech charges $10 for those functions and bumps storage as much as 31 days.</p>
