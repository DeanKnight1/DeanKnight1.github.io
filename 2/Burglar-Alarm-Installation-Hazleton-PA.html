<p>There are 2 main kinds of cameras that can be wired into a video surveillance system: internet procedure (IP) cameras and the conventional analog cameras. IP cameras are the more modern-day model of analog cameras, and while the individual cameras tend to be a little more costly, they offer a number of functions that analog cameras do not. Here's a look at the distinctions in between the 2 types of camera. Today's wireless home security systems are more steady than they used to be.
