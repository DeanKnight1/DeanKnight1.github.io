<p>When using IP cameras - as the majority of CCTV systems do nowadays - you will more than likely be looking at Cat5E or Cat6 cable televisions, which can move the big quantity of information needed by digital video and high resolutions at extremely quick speeds, and frequently over fars away. This is an upgrade from the coax cabling that generally powers analog security cameras; coax cable televisions are trusted, but not suitable with IP cameras. In many cases, Cat5e and Cat6 cables will also power the security cameras, eliminating the requirement for additional circuitry. When the security cameras are not connected to an NVR, this is called Power-Over-Ethernet and needs a PoE switch. Wireless security cameras may need less wiring in the walls however will still need cable televisions to power the security camera separately, normally via 110VAC power.</p>

We've seen 1-year, all the way up to 5-year contracts! On the other hand, we advise contract-free systems if you do not want to sign on the dotted line and be locked into a long-lasting arrangement (and who does?). Our pick: No contract.</p>
