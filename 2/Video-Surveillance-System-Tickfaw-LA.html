<p>Brand name acknowledgment has considerable worth when it comes to deterring prospective break-ins.

<p>I simply finished updating all of my stock annke cameras with this design. The essential difference with this bullet camera is it has a horizontal modification which enables you to modify the field of vision 1000% much better than a camera without a horizontal change. No idea why more bullet cameras do not have this extremely important feature. Also nice metal building and construction. Needed to hold the button down for 5 seconds to the left to get right mode not in black and white. Had to make the wire hole a little bigger to fit the huge selection device into the wall. Should be a better way to execute that. However it was simply a little notch so not an offer breaker. Very good resolution - far better field of view vs the stock annke cameras and much better clarity in the evening. Ideally these hold up throughout the years! Highly suggest.</p>
