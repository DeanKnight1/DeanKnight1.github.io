<p>Alarm monitoring becomes part of a total home security system.

The control panel communicates with the other parts of the system, consisting of the cameras, doors and window sensing units, and motion sensing units, to identify an intruder or something that is wrong. Then, the monitoring company right away sets to action, connecting with you and notifying the authorities.</p>

It is believed that the increased surveillance provided by CCTV will decrease criminal activity and boost arrest, without displacing criminal activity to other neighboring areas where CCTV is not in usage (Ratcliffe 2009).</p>
