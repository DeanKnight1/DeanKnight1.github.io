<p>We love that the Argus 2 features a color night vision option, however the black and white version can in fact be clearer and provide you higher-quality video footage. This isn't truly a huge deal thinking about the Argus 2's price and all its other features-- however for the record, stick with black and white. With Arlo Pro 3, you'll get 3 months of Arlo smart service. But the coolest function is that you can charge it with the help of solar power with a solar panel charger.</p>
<p>The Arlo Pro 3 is good but not excellent-- therefore it isn't worth paying two times the price of its predecessor. When the two are compared side by side, the Arlo Pro 3 does edge out the Pro 2 on battery life and image, with 2K HDR video that is sharper during day and nighttime watching. However, color night vision image quality is disappointing, and the motion tracking feature is a bit wonky. Likewise, the Pro 3 uses no free storage, and external storage can't be seen through the app, only by means of a computer system. We will keep monitoring the Arlo Pro 3, however for now, we still think the Arlo Pro 2 is a better buy. Both are still much better than the costly Arlo Ultra, which we found to have awful night-vision performance, bad battery life, and a propensity to miss far too many motion triggers.</p>
