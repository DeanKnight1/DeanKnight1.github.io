<p>This nifty clever alarm has a motion detector and siren in one gadget. Throughout testing, we found it was easy to arm and disarm and the motion detection was precise, with the siren quickly triggering when motion was found.

For most homes, you'll need a number of Minuts throughout your residential or commercial property, which can get expensive. It's also worth noting that it has to be set up on the ceiling (it only keeps an eye on for motion in the 25m squared below), which is fiddly.
