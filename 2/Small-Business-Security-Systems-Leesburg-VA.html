<p>The remainder of the field is more specialized, dealing with advanced wise home connoisseurs or fans of a specific ecosytem of items. Nest's Secure has the very best design of any system I checked, including creative things like integrating the keypad and a motion detector into the base station and integrating motion detectors and entry sensing units into one system.
