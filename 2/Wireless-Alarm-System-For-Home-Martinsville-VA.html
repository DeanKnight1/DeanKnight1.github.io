Will they be able to record and see video efficiently in low-lighting? Are they put with adequate field of view, or will a PTZ (Pan Tilt Zoom) camera be necessary? When choosing security cameras for your CCTV system, these are all important questions to be thought about.</p>

<p>The Arlo Pro 3 is good however not great-- and so it isn't worth paying twice the rate of its predecessor. When the 2 are compared side by side, the Arlo Pro 3 does edge out the Pro 2 on battery life and image, with 2K HDR video that is sharper during day and nighttime viewing. However, color night vision image quality is frustrating, and the motion tracking feature is a bit wonky. Also, the Pro 3 uses no free storage, and external storage can't be seen through the app, just through a computer system. We will keep monitoring the Arlo Pro 3, however for now, we still think the Arlo Pro 2 is a much better buy. Both are still better than the costly Arlo Ultra, which we found to have terrible night-vision efficiency, poor battery life, and a tendency to miss out on far too many motion triggers.</p>
