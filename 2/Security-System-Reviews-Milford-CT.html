The second category of camera, commercial-grade cameras, typically starts at about $400 (United States) per camera-- a significantly greater price.

In a lot of cases, Cat5e and Cat6 cables will also power the security cameras, getting rid of the need for more electrical wiring.

Wireless security cameras may need less circuitry in the walls but will still require cables to power the security camera separately, normally via 110VAC power.</p>
