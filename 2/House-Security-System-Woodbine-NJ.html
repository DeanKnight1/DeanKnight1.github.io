<p>Since it's more complex than it must be, we don't suggest the SmartThings SmartCam. Recordings, alerts, and integration all require different IFTTT-style guidelines. Recordings are recorded as 10-second clips that are kept for up to 24 hr, unless you pay the $8 month-to-month cost (or $80 per year) to save 30-second clips for one month. Beyond those limitations, we often discovered action missing, thanks to prolonged and irregular spaces in between recordings. Also, the camera itself gets exceptionally hot.</p>
<p>In addition, there are lots of wireless home security brand names that will permit you to personalize a system to match your specific needs. For example, you might require a control board with 10 sensors versus the 4 sensors that might include other packages. Or, you may require different types of sensors such as those that monitor environmental disasters and other household dangers like fire and carbon monoxide, and so on. Or perhaps you are a senior and want to add a medical alert button and the associated equipment to your security system.</p>
