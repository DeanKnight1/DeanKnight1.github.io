For example if the only thing blocking the NVR from a camera is a window there would not be much of a concern however if there is an insulated wall in between the camera and NVR or the NVR is down stairs and the camera is mounted on 2nd story wall, this would cause an interruption in the signal.

<p>Beyond the scope of safeguarding a business from theft and vandalism is the monetary protection that a security system provides.
