<p>The Alarm Systems & Intrusion Detection product classification is a collection of news, product listings and other resources for security specialists looking into Alarm Systems & Intrusion Detection items. We thought about both the TP-Link Kasa Area (KC100) and the Kasa Camera (KC120) for among our top spots. Nevertheless, neither model has geofencing, and the KC120 left spaces of approximately 25 seconds in between recordings. The Spot can tape approximately 3 minutes without gaps in between clips, but entries were frequently missing, regardless of appearing in the app's activity timeline.
