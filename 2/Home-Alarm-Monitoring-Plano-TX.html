<p>A compelling argument in favor of getting the Circle Safe subscription is that it adds individual detection, that makes for smarter smartphone notifies-- and, sometimes, less incorrect alerts. You will not have to fret about it tape-recording or sending an alert every time the dog strolls by if the camera is pointed toward a high-traffic area. (We believe this is a better feature if you're placing the Circle 2 outside, where cars and trucks regularly pass.)
