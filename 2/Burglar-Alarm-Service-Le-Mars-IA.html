This varies from a CCTV camera, which can only send out and get signals through a cable connected to a DVR.</p>
<p>The NVR removes these issues, since it is rather connected straight to a network. IP cameras that are linked to the very same network, generally by way of a PoE switch, are then able to transmit footage to the NVR. Systems based around an NVR are much easier to scale up than DVR systems, just due to the fact that they can accept a new camera once it is added to the network. In the worst case, all that would be required is an additional PoE switch. Some IP cameras are also wireless and can send footage to the NVR over Wi-Fi. There are no distance constraints so long as a camera is linked to the exact same network as the NVR. The largest disadvantage to an NVR system, nevertheless, is that not every IP camera will deal with every NVR. So you'll need to understand whether your cameras will be compatible with a given video recorder before buying.</p>
