<p>In its truest type, a CCTV camera is an analog camera that sends signals via coax cable to a single main place for recording, video, and monitoring analysis. While the current pattern is a push towards IP network cameras, CCTV cameras are still commonly used, and provide an affordable answer to numerous common surveillance situations. When doors and windows open, be the first to understand. Connect all your Ring Alarm components and combine them to your mobile devices with the Ring Base Station.</p>
<p>IP security cameras record analog images and transform them to digital signals inside the camera, with some digital processing capabilities like compression and motion detection. The caught digital video stream is then broadcast over a local location network (LAN) utilizing Ethernet (CAT5 or CAT6) cable to a Network Video Recorder (NVR), which catches each camera's signal, compresses, and records it to a storage drive for retrieval and review. The system can be established to interact via network or mobile app for viewing.</p>
