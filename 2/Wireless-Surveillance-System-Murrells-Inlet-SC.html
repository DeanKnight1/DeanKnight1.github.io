The Nest Aware service is what makes this camera stick out-- it's what supplies the video history and smarter notifies, for instance. Nevertheless, those functions come at a comparatively high cost: $5 each month ($50 each year) for the very first camera for five days of video history, $10 per month ($100 annually) for 10 days of video history, or $30 monthly ($300 each year) for one month of video history.  For each additional camera, the membership is marked down to about half of the initial cost.
