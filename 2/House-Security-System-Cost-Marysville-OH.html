<p>Piza and coworkers (2019) conducted a new review of the literature to update a meta-analysis by Welsh and Farrington (2008) that looked at the impacts of closed-circuit tv (CCTV) surveillance on criminal offense avoidance. The researchers looked for CCTV examinations published in between 2007 and 2017 to represent the period since the last evaluation (which covered evaluations finished in 2006 and earlier).

Like stand-alone motion detectors, these can trigger when you're far from home or whenever you select. For example, you might keep the window sensing units always activated however shut off the door sensing units when you're at home.
