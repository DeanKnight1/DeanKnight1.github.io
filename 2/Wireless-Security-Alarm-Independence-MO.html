Humans have five senses that collectively enable us to properly vary our environment. Therefore, it just makes sense that a security system that engages as many senses as possible is more efficient.

We have actually seen 1-year, all the method as much as 5-year agreements! On the other hand, we recommend contract-free systems if you don't want to sign on the dotted line and be locked into a long-lasting contract (and who does?). Our pick: No contract.</p>
