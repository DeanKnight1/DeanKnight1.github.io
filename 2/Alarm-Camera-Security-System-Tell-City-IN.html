<p>Good photo and I like that the cameras are white, they don't stick out too much. Pretty easy to install.

<h3>Affordable Home Security Systems in Indiana</h3>

<h3>Residential Alarm Systems Tell City IN 47586</h3>
<p>Blink cameras are compact, include free storage, and use two AA batteries that can last as much as two years. However, to save that battery power, recordings max out at just 10 seconds, with the system leaving a gap of between 12 seconds and 35 seconds from one clip to the next. Likewise, the Blink does not provide you geofencing or two-way interaction, and its 720p image was a bit fuzzy in darker areas. To recoup costs and hold alarm companies accountable for incorrect alarms, Seattle works straight with your alarm company instead of with you. Your alarm company should be certified, pay any registration or false alarm costs, and provide physical proof like camera video or a damaged window to require authorities reaction.</p>

<p>Neither the light nor the camera is particularly impressive on its own. The Maximus Smart Security Light camera is HD, but it's only 720p-- and we're beginning to expect 1080p, if not 4K, from the security camera industry. With that stated, we would not recommend this system to tech-lovers, as we think the features are a little too basic. For instance, we would have liked to see an outdoor camera and more wise home functions. But if simple Do It Yourself installation, no-contracts, and low-cost monitoring is your thing, we believe you'll love SimpliSafe.</p>
