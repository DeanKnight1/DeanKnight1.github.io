<p>The growing existence of public cameras will bring subtle but profound modifications to the character of our public areas. When citizens are being seen by the authorities - or mindful they may be seen at any time - they are more uneasy and less free-wheeling. As syndicated columnist Jacob Sullum has actually mentioned, "knowing that you are being enjoyed by armed federal government agents tends to put a damper on things. You do not wish to offend them or otherwise call attention to yourself." Eventually, he cautions, "individuals might find out to be careful about the periodicals and books they read in public, avoiding titles that might alarm hidden observers.
