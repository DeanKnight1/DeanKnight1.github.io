<p>I simply ended up updating all of my stock annke cameras with this model. The key difference with this bullet camera is it has a horizontal adjustment which permits you to tweak the field of vision 1000% much better than a camera without a horizontal modification. No hint why more bullet cameras do not have this very essential function. Likewise nice metal building and construction. Had to hold the button down for 5 seconds to the left to get proper mode not in white and black. Needed to make the wire hole a little larger to fit the huge choice device into the wall. Must be a much better method to execute that. But it was just a little notch so not an offer breaker. Excellent resolution - much better field of vision vs the stock annke cameras and better clearness at night. Hopefully these hold up over the years! Extremely recommend.</p>
