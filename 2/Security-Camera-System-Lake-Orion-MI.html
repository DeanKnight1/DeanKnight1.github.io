<p>A wireless doorbell camera can work as a stand-alone gadget or in tandem with the rest of your security system. It triggers the doorbell camera when somebody sounds the doorbell.

On the other hand, we advise contract-free systems if you do not want to sign on the dotted line and be locked into a long-term arrangement (and who does?). Our pick: No contract.</p>
