<p>A self-monitored home security system counts on the homeowner to enjoy their home and contact police in case of an emergency situation. A self-monitored system doesn't suggest a house owner has to sacrifice any features.

<p>In The Sims, a burglar alarm will cover a whole room when put indoors. It will cover a 5-tile radius if placed on an outside wall. When a provider permits customers to monitor their own homes, this is called self-monitoring."

In many cases, consumers can also inspect the app to see live video footage from security cameras.</p>
