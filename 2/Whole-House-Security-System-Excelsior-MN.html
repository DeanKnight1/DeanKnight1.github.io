<p>There have actually long been reputable rules governing the audio recording of individuals without their consent (there is a factor surveillance cameras never ever have microphones).

<p>Commercial-grade cameras fix this issue with a special light-handling function. These cameras utilize both a software and hardware service called HDR, which stand for High Dynamic Variety". In our example here, HDR takes a direct exposure of the room and an exposure of the doorway and after that combines the two images together to produce a properly-exposed composite image of the two areas. As far as anyone is concerned, the image looks completely regular given that the doorway and room appear to be at the very same brightness level. As a result, faces are appropriately exposed at the door and in the store, accomplishing the goal of recording video of everyone getting in the store.
