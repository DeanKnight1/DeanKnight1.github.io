<p>Another essential subject to go over is camera resolution. It can be confusing to comprehend how much suffices. In this post, the term resolution" refers to the number of dots (pixels) that comprise a video image; the more dots, the more in-depth the video image. The same is true of high-resolution TV sets, and the 2 most popular TV resolutions today are 1080p and 4K. 4K resolution contains about 4 times as much picture information as 1080p. Surveillance cameras are likewise produced in these 2 resolutions, and it would be natural to believe that the more dots in your video image the better, right? Yes and no. There are some difficult consequences to having such a high-resolution 4K image when it comes to surveillance cameras. In this case, more is not always better.</p>
