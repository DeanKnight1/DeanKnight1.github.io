<p>Network cameras can be used for extremely cheap surveillance solutions (needing one network camera, some Ethernet cabling, and one PC), or to replace entire CCTV installations (cameras end up being network cameras, tape recorders become DVRs, and CCTV monitors ended up being computers with TFT screens and specialised software.

<p>The Wi-Fi Protected Access (WPA and WPA2) security protocols were later on produced to deal with the issues with WEP. If a weak password, such as a dictionary word or short character string is used, WPA and WPA2 can be split. Using an enough time random password (e.g. 14 random letters) or passphrase (e.g. 5 randomly selected words) makes pre-shared essential WPA practically uncrackable. The 2nd generation of the WPA security procedure (WPA2) is based upon the final IEEE 802.11 i modification to the 802.11 standard and is qualified for FIPS 140-2 compliance. With all those encryption schemes, any customer in the network that knows the secrets can read all the traffic.</p>
<p>For the a lot of part, wireless security equipment is only as noticeable as you desire it to be. Window sensors are easily concealed behind blinds or drapes, and door sensors are so small that they tend to blend into the doorframe.

If you're looking to improve your apartment's security, or simply want to keep an eye on your location while you're out, consider installing a portable wireless security system.</p>
