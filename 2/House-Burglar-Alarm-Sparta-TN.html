Most home security cameras use cloud services to save and offer remote access to video Some models have microSD card slots so you can physically pull the video from them when you want to review footage, but this is an unusual feature. Still, if innovation has made us susceptible, then it can also make us secure. Tech companies have actually been pushing difficult to innovate in the connected home CCTV camera area.

<p>I simply ended up updating all of my stock annke cameras with this design. The crucial difference with this bullet camera is it has a horizontal modification which enables you to fine-tune the field of view 1000% much better than a camera without a horizontal adjustment. No hint why more bullet cameras do not have this really important feature. Also nice metal building. Needed to hold the button down for 5 seconds to the delegated get correct mode not in white and black. Had to make the wire hole a little larger to fit the big selection device into the wall. Should be a much better way to execute that. However it was just a little notch so not a deal breaker. Great resolution - better field of vision vs the stock annke cameras and much better clarity at night. Hopefully these hold up over the years! Highly recommend.</p>
