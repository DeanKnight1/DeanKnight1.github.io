<p>so say you have a camera that someone can see it they would shoot it if they had a weapon so I suggest to have cameras integrated in to a house that will be pertected by cameras. Box cameras present an apparent sign for anybody who passes by that they are being tape-recorded on CCTV and this can be a terrific deterrent of theft and criminal offense. Whereas dome cameras are smaller and more discreet. These compact cameras are ideal for monitoring a bigger location such as your front or back garden and can follow movement with ease.</p>
