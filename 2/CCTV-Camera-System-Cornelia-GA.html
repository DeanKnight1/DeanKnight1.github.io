Without a paid Circle Safe subscription, you'll get more alerts, which you can only filter to receive every minute, 15 minutes, or 30 minutes. The membership is better when utilized in high-traffic locations. Otherwise, the Smart Area function can be set to disable recording when you're home-- to avoid notifies every time you walk by. Oddly, though the app supports numerous users, its geofencing uses to each user individually, so if everyone in your household has the Circle app set up, you'll still get notifications when other individuals are home.</p>
