<p>The NVR gets rid of these issues, due to the fact that it is instead connected straight to a network. IP cameras that are connected to the same network, generally by way of a PoE switch, are then able to transfer video to the NVR. Systems based around an NVR are much easier to scale up than DVR systems, simply since they can accept a new camera once it is added to the network. In the worst case, all that would be needed is an additional PoE switch. Some IP cameras are also wireless and can transfer footage to the NVR over Wi-Fi. There are no distance limitations so long as a camera is linked to the same network as the NVR. The biggest drawback to an NVR system, however, is that not every IP camera will work with every NVR.
