<p>Unlike most other cameras we evaluated, the corded Circle 2 does not have sensitivity settings for motion detection (though the cordless model does ). Rather, you can filter event alerts only by high activity, days, or individual (the latter is readily available only with a paid Circle Safe membership). Without a paid Circle Safe subscription, you'll get more alerts, which you can only filter to get every minute, 15 minutes, or 30 minutes. The subscription is more useful when utilized in high-traffic areas. Otherwise, the Smart Area function can be set to disable recording when you're home-- to prevent signals each time you walk by.
