<p>So, while alarm may have some benefit for alarm owners as part of a total security plan, the concern stays whether non-alarm owners in the community must shoulder a share of the cost. If alarm usage led to improved public safety-- that is, alarms resulted in much greater burglar apprehension rates or, ideally, fewer break-ins throughout an entire jurisdiction-- its public value would be more apparent. Nevertheless, the truth that alarm calls are overwhelmingly incorrect and do not contribute substantially to cops capability to capture robbers makes the underwriting of alarm reaction by cops and whole communities (all taxpayers subsidize authorities reaction to alarmed homes) a inefficient and expensive approach to burglary decrease throughout an entire jurisdiction.</p>
