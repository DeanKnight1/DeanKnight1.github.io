<p>The growing presence of public cameras will bring subtle but profound changes to the character of our public spaces. When residents are being enjoyed by the authorities - or aware they might be enjoyed at any time - they are more self-conscious and less free-wheeling. As syndicated columnist Jacob Sullum has actually explained, "understanding that you are being seen by armed federal government agents tends to deter things. You do not wish to upset them or otherwise call attention to yourself." Eventually, he cautions, "individuals may discover to be cautious about the books and regulars they read in public, avoiding titles that might alarm unseen observers.
