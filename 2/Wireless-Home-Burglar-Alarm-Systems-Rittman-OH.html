<p>According to a report, homes that do not have a security system are three times more likely to be robbed. With decades of experience setting up and monitoring video and audio security systems for Seattle companies and homes, we have actually built great relationships with both local police and their customers. Likewise, do not forget that your wireless network security can be in some cases weak, and vulnerable to exploits.

When buying a system online, be aware that most of the time expert alarm companies will not install consumer bought products! Why? Alarm companies do not understand if the bought items are utilized, do not work, or have compatibility problems.</p>
