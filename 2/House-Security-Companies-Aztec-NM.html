<p>Neither the light nor the camera is especially outstanding on its own. The Maximus Smart Security Light camera is HD, however it's only 720p-- and we're starting to expect 1080p, if not 4K, from the security camera market.

For example, we would have liked to see an outdoor camera and more wise home functions. But if easy Do It Yourself installation, no-contracts, and affordable monitoring is your thing, we think you'll enjoy SimpliSafe.</p>
