<p>So, while alarm might have some advantage for alarm owners as part of a general security plan, the question remains whether non-alarm owners in the community must shoulder a share of the cost. If alarm usage led to improved public safety-- that is, alarms resulted in much greater burglar apprehension rates or, preferably, fewer robberies across a whole jurisdiction-- its public worth would be more obvious. Nevertheless, the truth that alarm calls are extremely incorrect and do not contribute significantly to police ability to apprehend intruders makes the underwriting of alarm reaction by police and whole neighborhoods (all taxpayers support police response to alarmed residential or commercial properties) a costly and inefficient  technique to break-in decrease across a whole jurisdiction.</p>
