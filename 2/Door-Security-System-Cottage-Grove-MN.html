<p>CCTV surveillance equipment is a deterrent against fraud, vandalism, and theft. Recommendation: Often keyholders are not available and the alarm does not reset. If the alarm is malfunctioning and reactivates, we need to again respond to the alarm; each response is billed. Having a keyholder readily available to reset the alarm is one way of getting rid of costly false alarms. For example, if the carbon monoxide levels increase past a specific level, you can make it automatically turn off the heater.
