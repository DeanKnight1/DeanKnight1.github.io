The technology gradually progressed into the extremely advanced yet budget friendly systems available today. The first uses of CCTV cameras needed monitoring the feed in real-time - i.e., they did not have the means to record video and see it later on. Although video surveillance was monitored out of need in the early days, nowadays it is an intentional practice to enhance the result of security systems.</p>
