<p>Twenty-five years earlier, general and business interactions were primarily concurrent. To accomplish almost anything, someone live" required to be on the other side of the table or telephone line, specifically when handling worldwide and nationwide business. The same is true for security and video surveillance. Generally, CCTV is most efficient as an active system, with a security personnel monitoring the corridors and somebody else, somewhere, enjoying video surveillance monitors for assistance. Everything is integrated and everything takes place in real time.</p>
<p>Neither the light nor the camera is particularly excellent by itself. The Maximus Smart Security Light camera is HD, however it's just 720p-- and we're beginning to expect 1080p, if not 4K, from the security camera market. With that stated, we would not suggest this system to tech-lovers, as we think the functions are a little too basic. For instance, we would have liked to see an outdoor camera and more smart home features. But if easy DIY installation, no-contracts, and inexpensive monitoring is your thing, we think you'll enjoy SimpliSafe.</p>
