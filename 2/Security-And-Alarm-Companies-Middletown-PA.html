<p>If you have a bigger home or property you wish to watch on, SimpliSafe might be too restricted for you. The only outdoor security camera that's presently available is the Video Doorbell Pro, which is fantastic for watching on visitors and plan deliveries, but it leaves other parts of your backyard vulnerable. This system may not be the best fit if you have a big lawn or outbuildings to secure. Unlike the outdoor Arlo cameras, the Arlo Q does not require a base station-- it connects directly to any Wi-Fi network. But you can link the Q with other Arlo indoor and outdoor cameras in the Arlo app, which is offered for iOS, Android, Fire OS, and any Web browser.

<p>Neither the light nor the camera is particularly impressive on its own. The Maximus Smart Security Light camera is HD, however it's just 720p-- and we're beginning to anticipate 1080p, if not 4K, from the security camera market. With that said, we would not advise this system to tech-lovers, as we believe the features are a little too basic. For example, we would have liked to see an outdoor camera and more smart home functions. However if easy Do It Yourself installation, no-contracts, and affordable monitoring is your thing, we believe you'll enjoy SimpliSafe.</p>
