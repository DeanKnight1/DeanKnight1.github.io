<p>Pelco offers video surveillance cameras and video management options for commercial environments such as office complexes, shopping centers, hotels, and others. IP cameras work by using an IP (IP means internet protocol) network, typically the very same data network the rest of a company uses. A separate network using category 5 wiring can be utilized if bandwidth is an issue. In either case, video information is recorded on a server, which means video data can be found on site or in a remote location. After testing, we sent out each of our top choices, along with the Wyze Web cam v2, to Expense McKinley, head of information security at The New York Times (Wirecutter's parent company), for hack testing. (Bill is likewise a self-proclaimed paranoid infosec person.") He assessed each camera for any outstanding security defects and concluded that all of our top picks and the budget Wyze Cam passed basic security standards and defenses.</p>

If the camera is pointed toward a high-traffic location, you won't have to worry about it recording or sending out an alert each time the pet dog walks by. (We think this is a more valuable function if you're putting the Circle 2 outside, where cars frequently pass.)
