<p>In our tests, the Ring Alarm system sent mobile phone signals within 4 seconds of the alarm being triggered, with email signals as an alternative as well.

Confirmation calls from Quick Action, a third-party partner service, came within 60 seconds of our 113-decibel siren (per our measurements) being triggered; you can deactivate it by utilizing the app or by giving your personally chosen safe word to customer care The base station also informed us when it was disconnected from power, and it delivered on its guarantee of 24 hr of battery backup.</p>

As far as anyone is worried, the image looks totally normal since the doorway and space appear to be at the exact same brightness level. As a result, faces are correctly exposed at the door and in the shop, accomplishing the goal of catching video of everyone entering the shop. HDR is now a standard feature in commercial cameras.
