<p>Our CCTV surveillance camera systems are trusted by more than 60,000 organisations, universities, and government facilities, and residential customers. After looking into 4 different security systems, we picked SSA. They gave us the best description of their services and used us more for the cash. After having a bad experience with the local installer for ADT and canceling them, we experienced what a genuinely expert installation should be.

With standard CCTV security cameras, the video signal is processed and sent in analog format for local viewing from one central monitoring location.

<p>Cross-zoning is a strategy that does not require a new keypad. Utilizing multiple sensing units to monitor activity in one location, software analyses input from all the sources. For example, if a motion detector journeys in one area, the signal is taped and the central-station monitor notifies the consumer.
