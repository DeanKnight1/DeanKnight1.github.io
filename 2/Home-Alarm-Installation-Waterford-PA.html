<p>The problem with the small, fixed LED IR cameras is the plastic used in front of the lens and in some cases, the real lens. After a few years in the harsher climates, this plastic tends to fade and become milky. This makes it hard for the CCD or CMOS sensor to successfully equate the imagery, and if there's a series of LED IR lights surrounding the lens, it can cause a halo-like affect that blurs the image day and night. Inside your home, these gadgets have a far longer life expectancy, however outdoors, or even in a garage without climate control, many of them lose their sharpness and clearness catching the severe environment.</p>

<p>I simply finished updating all of my stock annke cameras with this design. The key distinction with this bullet camera is it has a horizontal modification which allows you to modify the field of vision 1000% better than a camera without a horizontal modification. No clue why more bullet cameras do not have this very important feature. Likewise great metal building. Needed to hold the button down for 5 seconds to the left to get correct mode not in black and white. Had to make the wire hole a little bigger to fit the huge choice device into the wall. Need to be a much better method to implement that. However it was just a little notch so not a deal breaker. Great resolution - better field of vision vs the stock annke cameras and far better clarity at night. Hopefully these hold up for many years! Extremely recommend.</p>
