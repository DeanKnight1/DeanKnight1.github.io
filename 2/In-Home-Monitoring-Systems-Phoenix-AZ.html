<p>In August 2019, the LockPickingLawyer YouTube channel posted a video demonstrating how to hack into a SimpliSafe system using a $2 remote. When it identified any type of interference, SimpliSafe reacted with a statement stating the system would signal users. The company also questioned the video, declaring that there would need to be an ideal storm of scenarios for somebody to successfully hack the system. Over a week, we ran more than 25 tests using two various 433 MHz remotes, with contact sensing units located 6 to 26 feet away from the SimpliSafe Base Station, and we were unable to duplicate the concern. Although our screening should not be taken as definitive, we believe this issue is not likely to be a real-world problem for SimpliSafe clients who own the present system.</p>
