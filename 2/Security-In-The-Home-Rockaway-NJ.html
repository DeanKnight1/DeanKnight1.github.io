<p>3 big advantages of wireless security systems for renters are their expandability, impermanence and mobility. Tenants, unlike homeowners, typically avoid making long-term modifications to their homes. Hardwired security systems therefore aren't useful; they involve drilling into walls and installing irreversible electrical circuits. In contrast, wireless security uses equipment that's either freestanding or attached to walls and entranceways with removable adhesive. Wireless control panels, sensors and other components can easily be established at various properties later, and wireless systems are easily expanded with new elements too. Wireless security strategies also permit push-button control of the system and general home automation. Check out our list of top systems with home automation functions if home automation is your main appeal.</p>
