Limit access to your residential or commercial property with hedges, fencing, and tough shrubs. Also, it's simple to overshare on social media, however it's wise not to broadcast any upcoming journeys or family vacations so bad people can discover when you're gone.

<p>It would be easy to roll your eyes at this last point, but it suggests you can ask your home security camera for the weather forecast - or whatever Google search takes your fancy - and a speaker within the system will reply. It likewise implies that if you actually saw a burglar riffle through your home, you could rapidly tape-record a message to him or her through your mobile phone, and the Nest would play it aloud.
