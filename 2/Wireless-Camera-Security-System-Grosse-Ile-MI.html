The Arlo Pro 2 is likewise the only cord-free 1080p camera on our list that offers seven days of totally free cloud storage (with more available for a monthly charge ). However, the camera will reset the sensing unit in between recordings, which Arlo says will permit the camera to effectively identify motion and not get stuck tape-recording on a loop. That likewise conserves battery life, but it may leave you with taping gaps during important security events.
