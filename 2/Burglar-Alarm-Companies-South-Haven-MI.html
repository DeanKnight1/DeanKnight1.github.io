<p>So, while alarm systems may have some advantage for alarm owners as part of a general security package, the concern stays whether non-alarm owners in the neighborhood must shoulder a share of the cost. If alarm use led to enhanced public safety-- that is, alarms led to much higher burglar apprehension rates or, preferably, less robberies across an entire jurisdiction-- its public worth would be more apparent. However, the reality that alarm calls are overwhelmingly false and do not contribute significantly to authorities capability to nab robbers makes the underwriting of alarm reaction by cops and whole neighborhoods (all taxpayers fund cops reaction to alarmed homes) a inefficient and pricey technique to theft reduction throughout a whole jurisdiction.</p>
