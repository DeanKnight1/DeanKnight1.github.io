Bullet cameras tend to be amongst the most popular outdoor choices because their style permits minimum glare. In terms of detection, it is much better to have a camera equipped with infrared detection rather than motion detection. This will supply more precise and less frequent signals because often times the motion detection is triggered by motion such as a tree blowing or an animal running by.</p>
