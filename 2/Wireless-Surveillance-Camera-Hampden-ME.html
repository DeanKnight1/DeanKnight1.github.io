<p>CCTV surveillance equipment is a deterrent versus fraud, theft, and vandalism. Idea: Typically keyholders are not readily available and the alarm does not reset. We need to once again react to the alarm; each response is billed if the alarm is malfunctioning and reactivates. Having a keyholder readily available to reset the alarm is one way of getting rid of pricey incorrect alarms. For instance, if the carbon monoxide gas levels increase past a specific level, you can make it automatically shut off the heating systems.

The Maximus Smart Security Light camera is HD, however it's just 720p-- and we're beginning to anticipate 1080p, if not 4K, from the security camera industry.
