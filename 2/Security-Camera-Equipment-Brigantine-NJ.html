<p>Commercial-grade cameras resolve this issue with a special light-handling function. These cameras use both a software application and hardware solution called HDR, which mean High Dynamic Range". In our example here, HDR takes a direct exposure of the space and a direct exposure of the doorway and after that integrates the 2 images together to create a properly-exposed composite picture of the 2 areas. As far as anybody is concerned, the image looks entirely normal because the entrance and space appear to be at the same brightness level. As a result, faces are appropriately exposed at the door and in the store, achieving the objective of catching video of everyone going into the store. HDR is now a basic function in commercial cameras. Unfortunately, as soon as consumers recognize that the low-cost consumer camera they bought is lacking HDR, it's typically far too late because the recorders and cameras are installed.</p>
