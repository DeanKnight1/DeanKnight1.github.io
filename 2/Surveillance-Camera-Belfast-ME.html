<p>This awesome smart alarm has a motion detector and siren in one device. During testing, we discovered it was simple to arm and disarm and the motion detection was accurate, with the siren quickly triggering when motion was found. We enjoy that it also lets you understand when other alarms are going off, such as a smoke or CO2 detector. For most homes, you'll need numerous Minuts throughout your property, which can get expensive. It's also worth keeping in mind that it has to be set up on the ceiling (it just keeps an eye on for motion in the 25m squared listed below), which is fiddly.
