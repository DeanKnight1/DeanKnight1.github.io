<p>The DoS attack in itself does little to expose organizational information to a harmful attacker, since the disturbance of the network prevents the flow of data and in fact indirectly protects information by avoiding it from being sent. The normal reason for carrying out a DoS attack is to observe the recovery of the wireless network, during which all of the initial handshake codes are re-transmitted by all devices, supplying an opportunity for the destructive attacker to tape-record these codes and use various breaking tools to examine security weaknesses and exploit them to get unapproved access to the system. This works best on weakly encrypted systems such as WEP, where there are a variety of tools available which can launch a dictionary design attack of "possibly accepted" security keys based upon the "model" security crucial caught during the network recovery.</p>
<p>Commercial-grade cameras resolve this problem with a special light-handling function. These cameras use both a software application and hardware option called HDR, which represent High Dynamic Range". In our example here, HDR takes a direct exposure of the room and a direct exposure of the entrance and after that combines the 2 images together to produce a properly-exposed composite picture of the two areas. As far as anybody is concerned, the image looks entirely normal since the doorway and room seem at the very same brightness level. As an outcome, faces are effectively exposed at the door and in the store, achieving the objective of recording video of everyone getting in the store. HDR is now a basic feature in commercial cameras. Sadly, once consumers realize that the inexpensive customer camera they bought is lacking HDR, it's typically too late because the cameras and recorders are set up.</p>
