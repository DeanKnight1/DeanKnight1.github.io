<p>I simply ended up upgrading all of my stock annke cameras with this design. The essential difference with this bullet camera is it has a horizontal modification which allows you to fine-tune the field of view 1000% much better than a camera without a horizontal change. No idea why more bullet cameras do not have this very important function. Also good metal construction. Needed to hold the button down for 5 seconds to the left to get right mode not in black and white. Needed to make the wire hole a little larger to fit the substantial selection gadget into the wall. Need to be a better method to execute that. However it was just a little notch so not a deal breaker. Very good resolution - far better field of view vs the stock annke cameras and far better clarity during the night. Ideally these hold up for many years! Highly suggest.</p>
