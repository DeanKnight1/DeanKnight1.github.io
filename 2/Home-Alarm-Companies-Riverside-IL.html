Well, it's a prepackaged security kit that offers basic intrusion protection with super-low month-to-month monitoring costs. Or ... no monitoring charges at all if you select the complimentary self-monitor" choice.</p>
<p>IP cameras are much greater resolution, allowing audio and video surveillance to be sent over a network, with IP addresses assigned to each camera.

<p>I just ended up upgrading all of my stock annke cameras with this model. The crucial distinction with this bullet camera is it has a horizontal change which enables you to tweak the field of view 1000% better than a camera without a horizontal modification. No hint why more bullet cameras do not have this very crucial feature. Also great metal construction. Needed to hold the button down for 5 seconds to the delegated get right mode not in black and white. Had to make the wire hole a little bigger to fit the huge choice device into the wall. Need to be a better way to carry out that. But it was just a little notch so not a deal breaker. Very good resolution - much better field of view vs the stock annke cameras and far better clarity during the night. Hopefully these hold up throughout the years! Highly advise.</p>
