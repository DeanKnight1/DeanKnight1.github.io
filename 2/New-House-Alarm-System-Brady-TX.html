<p>Unlike many other cameras we checked, the corded Circle 2 does not have sensitivity settings for motion detection (though the cordless model does ).

Without a paid Circle Safe membership, you'll get more notifies, which you can just filter to get every minute, 15 minutes, or thirty minutes. When utilized in high-traffic areas, the subscription is more helpful. Otherwise, the Smart Location function can be set to disable recording when you're home-- to prevent signals every time you walk by. Oddly, though the app supports numerous users, its geofencing uses to each user individually, so if everyone in your household has the Circle app installed, you'll still get notices when other people are home.</p>
