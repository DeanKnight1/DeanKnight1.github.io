It also includes two days of complimentary cloud storage (with an option for more ), which can cram in clips of as much as 3 minutes. Nevertheless, we had a handful of tests where recordings eliminated in the middle of the action and would leave 13-second spaces in between clips. Protective Systems utilizes a touch-screen control board and keypads, different sensors (motion, glass break, smoke, carbon monoxide, door contacts), and surveillance cameras to monitor homes. They are the only company of the 4 discussed that utilizes a combination of wired and wireless technology so keep that in mind when deciding.</p>
<p>Keypad: A smartphone app is a must for use when you're far from home, however you should not need to fumble with your phone when you're reoccuring.

Obviously, at that point, the cheap price tag ends up being more expensive.</p>
