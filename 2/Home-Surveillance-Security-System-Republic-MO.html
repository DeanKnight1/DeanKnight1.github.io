<h2>The Best Smart Home Security Systems For 2020 Republic</h2>
<p>Although it has a lot of versatility in positioning, the Nest Camera Outdoor does need a power source, so it must be placed within reach of an outlet. This can be an issue outside your home.

Both likewise do not have person detection and geofencing, which other cameras use to cut down on false alerts.</p>
