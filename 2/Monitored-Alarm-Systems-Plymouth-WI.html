<p>Thank you for your feedback, Don. We have actually found that battery life never matches the maker's stats considering that this originates from tests in a controlled environment without continuous video recording, which is the greatest culprit for brief battery life by far. We agree with you about Blink's remarkable battery life over on our outdoor security camera review, but its recording capability is a bit limited to recommend as a top pick.</p>
<p>Aside from good Wi-Fi, you might also need a close-by outlet. Many cameras require an AC connection, which suggests you will not have the ability to put them just anywhere.
