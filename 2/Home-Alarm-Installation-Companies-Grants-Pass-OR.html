Whilst these are fairly discreet CCTV cameras in appearance, this does not stop them from deterring criminals.

<p>The Randolph Municipality Cops Department is asking locals and organisations to register their privately-owned surveillance camera systems. As our officers react to reports of criminal activity in our neighborhood, they may have the ability to utilize the details or video footage caught on these security cameras to help in the apprehension and prosecution of the bad guys included. Safeguard Security & Communications is available in New Mexico and Arizona. The company utilizes cellular information for expert monitoring.</p>
<p>Neither the camera nor the light is particularly outstanding on its own. The Maximus Smart Security Light camera is HD, but it's only 720p-- and we're beginning to anticipate 1080p, if not 4K, from the security camera market. With that said, we would not recommend this system to tech-lovers, as we believe the features are a little too basic. For example, we would have liked to see an outdoor camera and more smart home features. But if easy DIY installation, no-contracts, and affordable monitoring is your thing, we think you'll enjoy SimpliSafe.</p>
